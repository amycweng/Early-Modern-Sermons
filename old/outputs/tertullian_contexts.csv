A14670,270,973,"Plinie writes of the Almond tree that it buds in Ianuarie, and brings forth fruit in March: to which these worthily may be likened, beeing so preprope∣rous and bold to were Aarons Ephod and his linnen garment before they be fit to put on the Christians cloake, wher∣of<CITATION> Tertullian speakes; who will touch the holy things before they wash them∣selues  at the brasen laver of the sanctua∣rie, wanting both the Vrim of know∣ledge, and Thummim of integritie: they ranne, saies the Spirit, but I sent them not, and we knowe none can preach but he that is sent."
A87797,154,0,"I know there are that deny this truth, <CITATION> that temporal death is the punishment of sin, as Pelagians and Socini∣ans upon different grounds and reasons, which I shall here neither canvase, much lesse go about to confute; only propound to sober judgements that of the Apostle; and , as he said, Paul for my money, Rom."
A03753,299,31,"It is true: but yet marke the distinction that Tertullian giues here:<CITATION> All flesh is not the same flesh, in equality of prerogatiue; but, all flesh is the same flesh, in community of nature."
A03753,554,51,"So likewise, though happely af∣fliction may bring a man to so lowe an ebbe and declination of fortune, as to leuell him with the ground; though death bring him yet lower, and lay him in his graue; yea, though his race, and his name, and his memory perish  among the liuing, as if he had neuer beene; yet there is a root still left in the earth, the body that sleepes in the dust, and that body is capa∣ble of a resurrection: as soone as the Spring of Iudgement shall begin to aduance, and that glorious Sunne of righteousnesse to appeare and shine in his strength; Surget caro, & qui∣dem  omnis, & quidem ipsa, & quidem integra, (as Tertullian speaketh) flesh shall rise,<CITATION> and all flesh shall rise, and that flesh shall rise which was buried before, and it shall rise with a full proportion of feature and perfection of parts without any diminution at all."
A03753,584,38,"And surely it is a good rea∣son that Tertullian giues for it,<CITATION> because (saith he) it stands in better congruitie with the na∣ture and maiestie of God, to restore to a being that which he once reiected, then vtterly to de∣stroy that which himselfe once made, and liked well too."
A87420,220,2277,"Well, walk with God, and all this yours: when others are sent away with a Depart from me,<CITATION> separated from the Presence of the Lord, you shall be with him, and lie in his bosome, in whose Presence is fulness of joy, and at whose right hand are pleasures for evermore."

A80547,331,51,"Tertullian hath a pressing Reason; and <CITATION> he presseth it too: Because Man is gra∣ciously made by God, a free Creature, undetermined in his Actions, untill he be determined by himself; And therefore, may not be drawn away from Sinning by Omnipotency; because God useth not  (neither doth it agree with him) to re∣peal his own Ordinances, or to proceed against them; As, Mercy may not do any thing, contrary to Providence."

A32857,1612,65,"Nay this you may do, though in your own opinion it be unlawful, because<CITATION> Bellarmine, a man with you of ap∣proved vertue, learning, and judgement, hath declared his opinion for the lawfulness of it in saying, that want of power to maintain a rebellion, was the only reason that the primitive Christians did not rebel against their persecuting Emperors."
A32857,2213,153,"And yet the Power of Christs Life, leaves us not here neither: Nay, all this is performed only to make us capable of greater blessings yet.<CITATION> For, by our sanctification and new-birth, we are (saith Tertullian) Restitutioni inaugurati, destin'd and consecrated to a glorious Resurre∣ction."

A63888,2269,726,"Yes: But he was put into a Cauldron of scalding lead and oyl, before the Port Latin in Rome, <CITATION> and scaped death by miracle, though no miracle was wrought to make him scape the torture: And besides this, he lived long in ba¦nishment, and that was worse then Saint Peters chains: Sanctus Petrus in vinculis, & Johannes ante portam latinam, were both dayes of Martyrdom and Church Festivals: and after a long and  laborious life, and the affliction of being detained from his crown, and his sorrows for the death of his fellow-disciples, he dyed full of dayes and sufferings: And when Saint Paul was taken into the Apostolate, his Commissions were signed in these words; I will shew unto him how great things he must suffer for my Name: and his whole life was a continuall suffering: Quotidiè morior was Acts 9."
A63888,3520,1363,"It was a vast power these men had, to be in proportion to their greatest honour: they had  power of bidding and dissolving publick meetings, of indicting so∣lemnities of religion; just as the Christian Bishops had in the be∣ginning of Christianity; they commanded publick fasts, at their indiction onely they were celebrated; Benè autem quod & Episcopi <CITATION> universae plebi mandare jejunia assolent; non dico industriâ stipium con∣ferendarum, ut vestrae capturae est, sed interdum, & aliquâ sollicitudinis Ecclestasticae causâ."
