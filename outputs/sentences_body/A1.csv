A19277,0,3,0,0,"IT hath béene from auncient time receiued, & verie long vsed in the Church of God (right worshipfull & Christian audience) at the Funerals of the godly to haue the worde preached to the people: Not thereby to profite the deade (which no way after life can chaunge this departing state) but by it to instruct the lyuing, (PB_4) that they may learne to die in the Lorde: & so rest from the labour of sinne & hell."
A19277,1,3,0,1,"And why may not the godly preacher, take occasion at funeralls to preach the worde of God Nay: why shoulde they omitte any occasion but rather with Christ & his Apostles waite oportunitie to preach the worde, whensoeuer the people be gathered together So Christ at Ierusalem, Iohn in the wildernesse, (NOTE_3:0_0) & Paul in Mars stréete preached the worde, where & in what place the people were assembled."
A19277,2,3,0,2,"The fathers likewise of the Church, of auncient time, haue at such assemblies, taken occasion to teach the liuing, euen when the funeralles were solemnized ouer the deade."
A19277,3,3,0,3,"Whereby it was, that those men did not only benefit ye Churh, during their liues, but euen their corps (as it were) did afforde a finall benefite to the same, at their departure to the earth."
A19277,4,3,0,4,"And though the Papistes haue abused much this sacred vse, so as, at this day, some vse it & suppose it, rather to benefite the dead, then séeking to profit the liuing thereby: yet is this no reason, why we should abstaine from food, or (PB_5) our parentes shoulde foreslow, to féed vs with the bread of life, bicause ye enemies of God haue abused it."
A19277,5,3,0,5,"Let vs then looke vpon this heauenly bread, which God (in mercie) by ye occasion of this christia corps here present, hath new, in the seruice of mine endeuour, offered vnto you."
A19277,6,3,0,6,"It is a cofortable consolation to ye children of God, spoken, & commanded to be written to them, yt they should not be swallowed vp, in the sorowes of sharpe persecution, & tyrannie of Antichrist: Or be beaten from the anchor of hope in God, whilest they are accursed of ye world: or be driue to dispaire vnder the crosse, by the multitude of afflictios: but should assure theselues, of his loue towards them, & of their estate in him, howsoeuer the malignaunt mindes of wicked men should bend their force against them."
A19277,7,5,0,0,"This scripture compriseth a resolute aunswere, to that often asked matter: namely, who is he that is truly blessed & what it is to bée blessed indéed."
A19277,8,5,0,1,"In answere whereof, the spirite of God obserueth (PB_6) this order."
A19277,9,5,0,2,First he declareth who they bée which be truely blessed.
A19277,10,5,0,3,"Secondly he doth elegantly set downe the condition & state of them, which are so blessed."
A19277,11,6,0,0," (PB_6) Touching the first: Who is blessed he aunswereth, Blessed is he yt hath part in the first resurrection."
A19277,12,6,0,1,"Concerning the seconde: And what is their blessednes He faith, For on such the seconde death shal haue no power: but they shal be ye priestes of God & of Christ, & shall raigne with him 1000 yeares, that is to say, for euer."
A19277,13,6,0,2,"That we may take sufficient profite of this Godly labour, let vs well obserue the text:"
A19277,14,6,1,0,"There hath béene no state so accursed, but the same hath desired to be blessed: Nor any people so sottish, that haue not, in cause of happy desire, sought after felicitie."
A19277,15,6,1,1,"But such as the dispositions of the persons were, such for the most part, was their supposall of felicitie. (NOTE_6:1_0)"
A19277,16,6,1,2,Some sort supposed it an happie thing to bée beautifull & braue. (NOTE_6:1_1)
A19277,17,6,1,3,"Some other déemed happinesse, to consist onely in rule & dignitie: And therefore haue tendered (PB_7) with hazarde, their soules to Hell, atchiuing by wicked practizes some stately seates in earth. (NOTE_6:1_2)"
A19277,18,6,1,4,"Some haue supposed ciuill honestie, to be the habite of true felicitie, & hauing obteined a faire course therein, haue onely rested there, as in the chaire of heauenly happinesse."
A19277,19,6,1,5,"But others more lewde, haue sonke themselues to hell: (NOTE_6:1_3) with gaping after earthly treasure, haue thesaured to themselues in déede, the malediction of God, against the day of wrath."
A19277,20,6,1,6,"Of this sort was that Diues, in the 12 of Luke, & likewise his companion, (NOTE_6:1_4) in the 16 of the same. (NOTE_6:1_5)"
A19277,21,6,1,7,"In whose earthly beatitude, appeare these deadly miseries: Namely, in obtaining riches a greedie desire, & in possessing them, a double mischiefe."
A19277,22,6,1,8,"To themselues, they did abounde in great prodigalitie, but vnto all other they were imprisoned in the déepe dungeon of needlesse nigardie."
A19277,23,6,1,9,"For theselues they gathered still, fared alwaye delicately, aparelled euer costly, stil open harted to their owne delights, but very narrowly chested to al others: which would haue ben resonably satisfied, with ye least part of their superfluous (PB_8) prouision."
A19277,24,6,1,10,"Oh, that ye states of our dayes would looke to this."
A19277,25,6,1,11,"Those Lords these knightes, & you the rich of this age, you suppose it your chiefe happines, to ioyne house to house, & lande to land, bloude to bloud, & thousands to thousands, & yet yee hunger after more."
A19277,26,6,1,12,"But (alas) the most of these doe suppose it, their blessednes, to haue a Rowlande for an Oliuer: To banquet & furfette with Bacchus, & to disporte & sléepe with Venus* To haue store of children, great wealth, sound bodies, stately buildinges, & noble names of the vulgar sorte."
A19277,27,6,1,13,"But beholde, both reason in earth, & tormentes in hell, shall teach you in trueth, that this is rather follie, then true felicitie."
A19277,28,6,1,14,"For if this be true happines, to be frée from al sorts of misery, & to abounde in all sacietie of good things, without appetite of farther or desire of more: howe can you reiecte reason, which telleth you (O earthly happie) yt you are yet in great misery For though in riches, yée surpasse Cresus in carnal venery, Sardanapalus, in delicate disshes, either the Epicure, or Bacchus in conioyned possessions euen (PB_9) Alexander the conqueror: yet your miserable mindes thinke, though we haue much, yet haue we not ynough."
A19277,29,6,1,15,"We are sorie our throtes be no déeper, our bellies no greater, our nights no longer, & our patrimonies no larger."
A19277,30,6,1,16,"For had you wonne the whole world, yet would you couet to haue another, & miserably yée feare the deserued fall of this you haue, which is euermore enuironed with miserable feare & blindnes, with feare to loose that they haue, by sundrie casualties: And so blinde, as not able to beholde the miserie of that ende, which hath none other heauen, then this present earth."
A19277,31,6,1,17,"But (Oh) come, & beholde the state of these blessed that are not godly rich, (O yée sonnes of men) & you shall bée enforced, if you hunger to bée truely blessed, to pray with that holy rich Dauid: (NOTE_6:1_6) Deliuer my soule from the wicked with thy sworde, from men (O Lorde) by thine hande, from men of the worlde, who haue their portion in this life, whose bellyes* thou fillest with thine hidde treasure: their children haue ynough, & leaue the rest of their (PB_10) their substance for their children."
A19277,32,6,1,18,"But I will beholde thy face in righteousnesse, & when I awake, I shall bee satisfied with thine image."
A19277,33,6,1,19,"That is: When I shall arise from the sleepe of naturall death, it shall bée full felicitie to me, that thou in thy mercy (O Lord) hast made mee thy creature, & liuely image, formed by & after thée, in holynesse & righteousnesse, & to enioy the fulnesse of thy face, (NOTE_6:1_7) which is true blessednesse."
A19277,34,10,0,0,"The tormentes of Hell in Diues, might sufficiently teach vs, howe false is the felicitie of earthly beautie, brauerie, dignitie, riches, & greatest glorie: If Christ bée not in them, your ende shall bée wéeping & woe: (NOTE_10:0_0) Hée was braue, but now is ye Godly Lazar beautifull: he was of great possessions, but Lazarus hath the kingdome: (NOTE_10:0_1) He gaped after gold, gay clothes, & delicate fare, but the despised man of God, is truely rich, decked with glory & delicately fed, with the countenance of the Lord."
A19277,35,10,0,1,Diues (supposed rich) is buried in hel.
A19277,36,10,0,2,"And by yt he greatly offended, in that, he is greatly punished: For his tongue is vehemently (PB_11) tormented in ye flame, he cryeth for fauour, but cannot obtain: for hée had no part of ye first resurrectio, (which is true beatitude:) & therefore must he néedes dwell for euer, in the seconde death."
A19277,37,10,0,3,"He would haue his brethre warned, that they dreame not of false felicitie, but the very way to blessednesses, is there taught him ( & also vs) not to bée learned from the deade: (NOTE_10:0_2) but of the liuing Lawe of the Lord."
A19277,38,10,0,4,"They haue Moses & the Prophets, let them heare them. (NOTE_10:0_3)"
A19277,39,10,0,5,"Be afraide ye gallants of the earth, you delicate Nymphes of these deayes (which term it now most delicate to you) iudge your selues, that ye be not iudged of the Lorde. (NOTE_10:0_4)"
A19277,40,10,0,6,Burie not your mindes in fained felicitie: but séeke you after true happinesse.
A19277,41,10,0,7,"If riches, honours, Castels, Lordships, Lands, Reuenues, & wordly goods greatly increase: set not your hearts vpon them."
A19277,42,10,0,8,"Be not locked into the Coffer of thy gold with Diues, but haue a godly liberal hart with Abraha."
A19277,43,10,0,9,"Rather sit at the doore of thy house ready to benefite thy countrie, the hauing many, to runne from al thy homestedes, to lye aloofe to féede thy selfe."
A19277,44,10,0,10,"Haue a Christian (PB_12) eye, to the whéele of false felicitie: For the more swéete shée séemeth, the sharper is her loose & whom she most fauoureth, him maketh she most fottish."
A19277,45,10,0,11,Truely the prosperitie of fooles destroyeth them. (NOTE_10:0_5)
A19277,46,10,0,12,"But if by grace from God, in thy part of the first resurrection, thou withstandest her pleasures, & vngodly desires: (NOTE_10:0_6) thou crownest then thy life with felicitie in him: Which God grant vs for his holy Christs sake."
A19277,47,10,0,13,And thus much of false flattering felicite.
A19277,48,10,0,14,"But yt we may be partakers of this blessednes, approued to vs here, by ye spirite of god, let vs lend our hearts to heare."
A19277,49,10,0,15,"Truely this felicitie is first by the Lorde, diffused to vs, in this life, but possessed by vs more amplie in heauen, at the houre of death, yet neuer fully obtained, till the time héere mentioned for the iust: namely, at the second resurrection: When we shalbe fréed from all woe, & shalbe filled with all fulnesse of ioy, & bée the priestes of God & Christ, to raigne with him a thousand yeare: that is, for euer & euer."
A19277,50,13,0,0,"This text doth first then yeld a resolute answere to this demand, & who are they which be truly blessed Truely saith our text: euen whatsoeuer he, yt hath part in the first resurrection, whether he be king or caytiffe, prince or potentate, preacher or people, rich or poore, he or she, yong or old, one or other."
A19277,51,13,0,1,"Come vp hither ye sons of me, raise vp you your heauy harts: for ye catholik curse of Adams loines, behold an vniuersal beatitude, in our common Christ."
A19277,52,13,0,2,"This absolute happinesse is not shut vp to a few, but as many, as can be partakers of ye first resurrectio: so many (I say) shal be blessed fro ye second death, which is the infernall lake of fire & brimstone."
A19277,53,13,0,3,"But for your better helpe to the comfort of this place, note héere wt mée, two thinges."
A19277,54,13,0,4,The first: what is this first resurrection.
A19277,55,13,0,5,"The seconde, how we may assure our selues to be partakers therof Now we must cosider, our text doth insinuate vnto vs a duple resurrectio: namely, a corporal & a spiritual. (NOTE_13:0_0)"
A19277,56,13,0,6,"The corporal resurrection, is ye supplie of this article: I beleeue the resurrection of the deade, & is common to all: for all fleshe shall die & ryse agayne to iudgemente."
A19277,57,13,0,7,"(PB_14) But the spirituall resurrection, is particular to the sones of God alone, & is called the first, because in this life, his holy spirit doeth kill the members of sinne, to death in vs, & rayseth vs vp togither in Christ, (NOTE_13:0_1) to a newnesse of life."
A19277,58,13,0,8,"But so necessarie a doctrine it is, to bée delyuered vs of either resurrection: that I may not omit, but speake of them both."
A19277,59,13,0,9,"And, as many scriptures doe testifie the first: so it is my purpose to charge your memories but with one: but that so sufficiet, as may alone suffice our purpose at this time, & your vnderstanding of Gods good pleasure, in that iudgement."
A19277,60,13,0,10,"viz. (NOTE_13:0_2) And I sawe a great white throne, & one that sate on it, from whose face fled away both the earth & heauen, & their place was no more founde."
A19277,61,13,0,11,"And I sawe the dead both great & small, stand before God, & the books were opened, & an other booke was opened, which is the booke of life, & the deade were iudged of those things, which were written in the books according to their workes."
A19277,62,13,0,12,"And the sea gaue vp her dead which were in her, & death & hell deliuered vp the deade which were in them: & (PB_15) they were iudged euery man according to their workes."
A19277,63,13,0,13,And death & hel were cast into the lake of fire: this is the seconde death.
A19277,64,13,0,14,"And whosoeuer was not founde in the booke of life written, was cast into the lake of fire."
A19277,65,13,0,15,"This holy scripture (beloued) doth most playnely lay abroad, the order & maner of iudgemet, at the last day."
A19277,66,13,0,16,"And first the maiestie of the iudge in his comming is described: Secondly, the maner of the iudgement, who they be, & wherof the Apparants be iudged."
A19277,67,13,0,17,"The Lords comming is with great glory, he sitteth on a mightie seat, farre passing the iudicial thrones of the greatest princes."
A19277,68,13,0,18,"And of necessitie that must bée a greate Seate, (NOTE_13:0_3) which must beare the God of might: It is a bright shining seate, all glorious, not with corruptible golde or precious stone, but with the heauely gleames, more bright then the Sunne beames, euen lightned with the brightnesse of his diuine glorie, as Christ hath saide: (NOTE_13:0_4) The sonne of Man shal come in his glorie, & he shall sit vppon the seate of his glorie, & all the holy Angels shall come with him."
A19277,69,13,0,19,"Whose glorious throne, doth euen teach (PB_16) vs, that the Lords iudgements are pure & without spotte."
A19277,70,13,0,20,"No pleading at the barre, no bribing of the iudge, no frending by aquest, no fauour found for siluer, nor loue or hate shall beare a sway, but equitie alone in him shall then bee séene."
A19277,71,13,0,21,"Also his brightnesse in comming, shal perce into the hearts & actes of al men, to manifest & lay open ye hidden secrets of the conscience, according to ye sentence of Paul: (NOTE_13:0_5) Iudge nothing before the time, vntill the Lord come, who wil lighten things that are hide in darkenes, & make the councels of the hearts manifest, & then shal euery man haue praise of God."
A19277,72,13,0,22,viz. as his labour asketh.
A19277,73,13,0,23,"Likewise the shinning sunne & moone, the glittering starres, yea, heauen & earth shall be darkened, & faile of their brightnes, before him."
A19277,74,13,0,24,"For like as the glorious sunne shinning, causeth the blasing torch to loose his brightnes, in respect of him: So shall that most beawtifull planet, be as darkened with the great glorie of this shining throne, in the comming of the Amightie Christ."
A19277,75,16,0,0,"But (my beloued) if these glorious creatures shal flée from the presence of (PB_17) this mighty CHRIST, comming to iudgement, which euer haue béene obedient to his holy will yea, & that but when he is comming: how shal it fare with vs, when he is set vpon that terrible throne whose sinnes haue béene so many, & the accusers so ready, (as the Lord his witnes, sathas accusation, (NOTE_16:0_0) & thine owne conscience, which is to thée 1000 witnesses) when the sunne is blacke, the Moone as blood, the stars fall, (NOTE_16:0_1) like the gréene figges from their trées, in a mightie wind, the heauens depart away like a scroll, (NOTE_16:0_2) & all ysles & montaines, are moued out of their places."
A19277,76,16,0,1,"And the kinges the of earth, & the great men, & the rich men, & the chiefe captaines, & the mightie men, & euery bondman & euery frée man, hide them selues in dennes, (NOTE_16:0_3) & amongst the rocks of the mountaines, & shall say to the mountaines & rockes, fall on vs, & hide vs from the presence of him, that sitteth on the throne, & from ye wrath of the lambe."
A19277,77,16,0,2,"In cause hereof, let me say vnto vs, with that holy Dauid Oh, (NOTE_16:0_4) cosider this, you that forget God, least the Lorde teare you in péeces, & there bée (PB_18) none to deliuer you."
A19277,78,16,0,3,"Séeing therefore yt all these thinges must be dissolued ( & come to passe) what manner of persons ought we to bée, (NOTE_16:0_5) in holy conuersation & godlinesse But when this iudge our Lorde Christ is thus gloriouslyset, then these foresaid persons of ech degrée, shall stand before him, euen great & smal: for neither heauen nor earth can hid them, or their crownes, their dignities, Lordships or warrelike courage, wealth, wil, or wit, shall be able to kéepe them from his presence, or escape the iust iudgemet which the balance of his equitie shal cast vnto the."
A19277,79,16,0,4,"Looke to this now, ye knights & gentils here present, & you rich in possessions, be not careles of your life: for godly preuention nowe, shal embolden your persons then, to lift vp your heades, because your redemption is the at hand. (NOTE_16:0_6)"
A19277,80,16,0,5,"This order then shall be obserued: The bookes shal be laid open before the Lorde: & euery man high & low, rich & poore, shall be iudged with the scepter of trueth, euen according as his déedes are written in those bookes."
A19277,81,16,0,6,"Note héere (beloued) by an elegant Metaphor, howe the spirite of GOD doth (PB_19) display the iudgementes of the Lorde."
A19277,82,16,0,7,"He alludeth vnto the iudiciall courtes of kinges & Potentates, where the bookes of recorde beare memorie of the faultes of men conuicted by good proofe."
A19277,83,16,0,8,"Not that the Lord hath néede of bookes: for he knoweth the thoughts, words & workes of all men, & of euery idle word, (NOTE_16:0_7) shall man be iudged: but, that héereby, he would sende vs, to our owne senses, to knowe & féele, that all our actions & heartes are in his sight, & cannot be wiped out of his remembrance by other pensill, then onely by true faith & repentance."
A19277,84,16,0,9,"And as we are fallen into this Metaphor, of the Lords bookes: So let vs know that the holy scriptures, (NOTE_16:0_8) attribute thrée bookes vnto God: viz. liber prouidentiae, Iudicii, & vitae: The booke of his prouidence: The booke of his iudgement: & the blessed booke of life."
A19277,85,16,0,10,"Of his prouidence, Dauid saith thus: (NOTE_16:0_9) Thine eyes did see mee, when I was without fourme: for in thy booke were all things writte, which in continuaunce were fashioned, when there was none of them before."
A19277,86,16,0,11,"O Lorde (sayth hée) (PB_20) when as yet I was not formed in my mothers wombe, thine eyes did see me, & in the book of thy foreknowledge & prouidence of thy diuine mind, were all men written from the foudation of the earth, when as yet there was not one begotten."
A19277,87,20,0,0,"The booke of his iudgementes, this former text doth enforce ye consideration of, which bookes were opened, & signifieth the certaine knowledge, of al the words & workes, of euery man, from Adam, tyll that instant, according to the which, they shall be all then iudged."
A19277,88,20,0,1,"For those things, which ye Lord now knoweth, as if he had them written in bookes, those thinges, that either our heartes, wordes or workes, haue imagined, spoken or done, the same then shall he then lay before vs, as if he redde them out of them, (NOTE_20:0_0) & shall thereby builde a reason vnto vs all, why some shall by iudgement goe to hell, some other vnto life."
A19277,89,20,0,2,"Be not deceiued therefore (good people) God is not mocked or beguiled: (NOTE_20:0_1) for we shall be adiudged of euery idle worde, yt shall be spoken: howe much more, of wicked déeds: as of idolatrie, whordome, blasphemie & such like Nowe go too, (PB_21) you that put farre away the euill day, (NOTE_20:0_2) & approch the seat of iniquitie, which take singular pleasure in ribauldry & filthy iesting: which can laughe the lowdest, when your lewde seruants are most disposed to lie."
A19277,90,20,0,3,"Doe you thinke indéed, ther is a God, that knoweth this A Scribe, that recordeth it A iudge, that will reuenge it & a day, that shall reueale it, by the bookes of your heauie iudgement And dare you continue your delight, in lying, whoring, in filthy iestinges, that are not comely, in such the workes of darkenesse, which rather you ought to reprooue in others, then to fauour or practise them your selues But these euils dwel not altogether in beggers, but you, you, eue you: (I say) who the Lord hath blessed with landes & reuenewes in great aboundance, which for your birthes, are called gentlemen, & for your chiualrie, knights: but for your follie, flattered as fooles, to winne of you preferment: euen of you (I said) there are, that dare dispise the spirit of trueth, with the false spirit of lying, ribauldry, & filthy whoredome."
A19277,91,20,0,4,"Your seruantes perceyuing your foolishnesse, are contented (PB_22) to sell themselues to hel, to gaine some earthly preferment at your handes."
A19277,92,20,0,5,"For, séeing your diuellish disposition, they frame their practise to your pleasurs: but you shalbe iudged of those thinges most seuerely."
A19277,93,20,0,6,"Oh, you seruing-men absteyne from pleasing your maisters, with this egregious lewdenes of lying."
A19277,94,20,0,7,"Wotte you what you doe & whose ye are (NOTE_20:0_3) you do make your soules the slaues of sathan, & you are herein, the children of the deuill your father, which is a lyer from the beginning."
A19277,95,20,0,8,"Cast of these works of darkenesse, haue no fellowship with them, but rather reprooue them, & those that vse them, yea, though they be your great masters."
A19277,96,20,0,9,"For, you are not called to serue men, but God."
A19277,97,20,0,10,"And you shall then be founde best profitable to your maisters, when you shall take sinne from their bodies, & exhort vertue to their soules."
A19277,98,20,0,11,"And be it knowne to you, you knightes héere present, & the rest, that, that noble Naaman had not béene clensed from his leprosie, had he not humbled his soule to the admonition of his godly seruing-men. (REF0) (NOTE_20:0_4)"
A19277,99,23,0,0," (PB_23) The Lorde GOD worke our conuersion in tyme, that wee may dye to sinne, & haue parte in the firste resurrection: so shall we bee sure not to taste of the seconde death: because our names are founde written, in the booke of life: Whereof nowe wee are to speake."
A19277,100,23,0,1,"And it is notable, that it is saide, euery man was iudged accordinge to his workes, that hée had done in his life time, not what others haue done for him, after."
A19277,101,23,0,2,"Yea, aswell the godly as the reprobate, are in theselues vnder the censure of the seconde booke, that is, condemnable to the seconde death."
A19277,102,23,1,0,"But now there is an other cause, why the godly are saued: namely, that their names are written in the booke of life. (NOTE_23:1_0)"
A19277,103,23,1,1,"This booke of life is not of this life corporall, but spiritual, & hath his beginning in these our dayes, but is perfited in the last resurrection, & is called the most sure, & swéete election & predestination of god, which doth seale & sanctifie to himselfe, those that be his, whom he hath chosen to be partakers of the first resurrection, before the beginning (PB_24) of dayes: (NOTE_23:1_1) & therefore they cannot perishe in the ende of time."
A19277,104,23,1,2,Of this booke speaketh Paule: The Lord knoweth who bee his.
A19277,105,23,1,3,"And though sparingly I would speak in singular reuerence of this hidde mystery, (NOTE_23:1_2) to many in ye world, & comfortable only to the childre of life, when their eyes be opened to reade this booke: yet in humblenesse of heart, I say thus much of it: This booke of life, is the most certaine, sure, firme, & eternall foreknowledge in the most holy minde of God, (NOTE_23:1_3) by the which hee euer hath & doeth in his Christ, & for him alone, appoint & choose vs, to be his children adopted to grace, & heires of eternall life, approueth them for his, & taketh peculiar & perpetuall care on them."
A19277,106,23,1,4,"I knowe my sheepe, saith Christ: I knowe whome I haue choosen & And those whome the Lorde writeth in this booke, those only shall haue saith & life."
A19277,107,23,1,5,"And whosoeuer is not written in this booke, without doubt, he shall be cast into the seconde death."
A19277,108,23,1,6,But howe shal we know that wee are written in this booke Surely euerie man is to séeke the knowledge héereof.
A19277,109,23,1,7,"To some it is (PB_25) giuen at morne, to other at noone, & to some onely at night, euen gasping at breath."
A19277,110,23,1,8,"The ordinarie way to this knowledge is elegatly set downe by Paul to the Romans, where the graces of God are so linked in one, & so easie to be perceiued, that euerie man may haue an insight, of this golden cheine yt feareth God. (NOTE_23:1_4)"
A19277,111,23,1,9,"We know that all thinges (saith he) worke together for the best, to to them that loue God, eue to them that are called of his purpose."
A19277,112,23,1,10,"For those who he knew before, he also predestinate to be made like to the image of his sonne, that he might be the first borne amonge manie brethren."
A19277,113,23,1,11,"Moreouer, Whome he predestinate, them also hee called, & whome hee called, them also hee iustified, & whome he iustified, them also he glorified."
A19277,114,23,1,12,"Héere, beloued, the booke is gods purpose to choose, & our writing in it is, that we are elected to liue in Christ before all times, a life conformable to the following of Christ: to bée holy & blameles, sober & godly, religious & iust, peaceable & blessed in this present worlde: And not to be worldly bent, & to blaspheme with rebellious (PB_26) spirites, saying: what should I feare to to robbe, to kil, to spoile, to whore it, & brace it, & to followe my lust For, if I be elected, I shalbe saued: if I be not elected, I shalbe daned."
A19277,115,23,1,13,"But beloued, Oh, hateful spirit against Gods holy spirit of our electio."
A19277,116,23,1,14,"Do you draw hence an other nature in the grace of this book namely, learne to sée, how those that are elected, those shalbe called to féele their election."
A19277,117,23,1,15,"And they shalbe iustified from their former corruptions, sanctified from after sinnes: & glorified to God."
A19277,118,23,1,16,"But as we haue said, those yt be not found writte in this booke, those shalbe iudged by ye other bookes of iudgement, & that according to their workes."
A19277,119,23,1,17,"This doctrine is héere deliuered vs to note: Iohn speaketh of the generall iudgement, executed long after the natural death, & he speaketh generally of all, when as (no doubte) great heapes of infinite thousands, haue had the works of Popes & Cardinals, popish priests, & sacrilegious Masses, trentals, doles & chauntrie fées, moonkish builde & frierish helpes for them."
A19277,120,23,1,18,"All whose works of darknesse notwithstanding, euery man shall rise vnchaunged, (PB_27) from his former state: For, euen so as he dyed, such shall he arise, & shall haue iudgement after his owne works, & not according to the merite of other mens labours for him after his death."
A19277,121,23,1,19,"Thus saith Gods spirite, which cannot lye: Away therefore with your prayer for the deade, your almes & dole to the poore, at the place & day of Funerals."
A19277,122,23,1,20,"And euen this day I exhort in the Lord, whom it doth most concerne, that as I knowe, & doe affirme your hate, to that pestilent péece of popery, & your sinceritie in Christ: so yée faithfully shewe it at this instant."
A19277,123,23,1,21,"Féede these poore assembled, but foster not that popishe opinion, to pray for the soule departed."
A19277,124,23,1,22,"Forget not ye Lord at this present, who hath not forgotte to bring you to great things."
A19277,125,23,1,23,Abstain (saith ye Apostle) not only from euill: but euen also from ye shadow & shew of euill.
A19277,126,23,1,24,"If it might be, take some other day for them & giue them wt warning, yt you meane no procuring of prayer for ye dead."
A19277,127,23,1,25,"For I know, yt you are assured, yt euery man shall appeare & aunswere for his owne factes, as well this reuerend corps going to his graue, (PB_28) as all you & wee here assembled, in cause of him."
A19277,128,23,1,26,"We must all appeare (saith Paule) before the iudgement seate of Christ, (NOTE_23:1_5) that euery man may receiue the things that are done in his bodie, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or euill."
A19277,129,23,1,27,"The Lord in mercy blesse vs with his grace, that liuing in him, we may die in the Lorde Christ, & so rest in peace, till our returne to this bodily resurrection, when we shall resigne to our soules, our newe bodies, though burned to ashes, eaten with vermine, in Sea, or by lande: For death, lande & sea, shall giue vppe, not newe creatures, but her receiued deade, to be revnited, to this resurrection."
A19277,130,23,1,28,"And so with holy Iob, we shall all sée our redéemer, not with other, but with these eyes, that nowe we haue, & with the selfe same bodies which nowe we beare, shall wée all both small & great, stande before the almightie Christ, the iudge of quick & deade."
A19277,131,23,1,29,To whom be glory for euer.
A19277,132,23,1,30,"And nowe time requireth to speake of the first resurrectio, which earst we called spirituall."
A19277,133,23,1,31,"And of this resurrection Paul speaketh thus: (NOTE_23:1_6) And when we were (PB_29) deade by sinnes, God in his rich mercie, through his great loue, wherewith hee loued vs, hath quickened vs together in Christ, by whose grace wee are saued: And hath raised vs vp together, & made vs sit together in the heauenly places in Christ Iesus. (NOTE_23:1_7)"
A19277,134,23,1,32,"And againe to the Romans thus: We are buried then with Christ by baptisme, into his death, that like as Christ was raised of God the father, so wee shoulde walke in newnesse of life."
A19277,135,23,1,33,"And nowe of these places we are to obserue: First, that there is a death, that goeth before this resurrection."
A19277,136,23,1,34,"Then, yt by an other power, beyonde our selues, we are reuiued, & raised from that death."
A19277,137,23,1,35,"And thirdly, what this life is, where vnto we are raised."
A19277,138,23,1,36,"To the first, this death is spiritual, & is none other but sinne, as here is saide: & when we were deade in sinne."
A19277,139,23,1,37,"And rightly is sin called death: for it killeth all the vitall partes of the soule, & maketh it not onely vnapt, but vnable to serue the liuing God."
A19277,140,23,1,38,It depriueth vs of the grace of God.
A19277,141,23,1,39,"It separateth Christ, (NOTE_23:1_8) which is our life, from vs, it bringeth sathan to possesse our soules, & haleth vs to the (PB_30) second death: which is the infernal lake."
A19277,142,23,1,40,"This is the nature of euery sinne, & therefore they are rightly saide to bée deade, which be possessed of it: as wholly cut off from God, estraunged from his life, (NOTE_23:1_9) & deade to godlynesse."
A19277,143,23,1,41,"So are the lashing widowes called deade in spirite, though they liue by nature, which giue themselues to carnalitie & fleshly lusts."
A19277,144,23,1,42,"And of such men also spake Christ the Lorde, saying: Let the deade burie their dead. (NOTE_23:1_10)"
A19277,145,23,1,43,"Nowe (beloued) drawe hence this doctrine: We are by course of naturall life sinners, but by our selfe delights, we are become deade in trespasses: but he that is dead, is so frée from life, that he hath no part of whatsoeuer is done vnder the sunne: as the preacher saith. (NOTE_23:1_11)"
A19277,146,23,1,44,"So now that I speake to you, that you conceiue, & we all féele the power of the voyce, it is by that wee liue: but this Corpes héere present, is so frée from all this, yt he neither heareth, or conceiueth, féeleth, or partaketh, whatsoeuer by his occasion héere is done: for hée is deade, & his life is not in him: Euen so (beloued) the deade in sinne are as frée from righteousnes, (PB_31) & the true féeling thereof: as this sanctified corpes is cut from our present action."
A19277,147,23,1,45,"Moreouer this corps can neither goe, nor stir, hinder or let those, that list to carry & conuey him whether they woulde: Neither can the deade in sinne, withstande the guide of his deadly soule, the killing diuell the prince of hell, but is ledde & drawen, euen whether & to what him lust: to whoredomes, murthers, lying, blasphemie, & what not (NOTE_23:1_12) For of whom so euer a man is ouercome, his seruant he is, whether of sinne vnto death, or of grace vnto life."
A19277,148,23,1,46,"Last of all, it is not in the power of any deade man to arise againe, till his life be returned to him: No more is it in ye power of man once deade in sin, to rise againe from it: vntill his life, which is Christ, returne, to reuiue him."
A19277,149,23,1,47,"Wherefore the Apostle saith, hee hath quickned vs, euen God the father, by the spirite of his Christ, hath raised vs vp with Christ."
A19277,150,23,1,48,"Where is then thy frée will, & power, to kéepe the wayes of God when thou hast eares, but fatted eares, that cannot heare: a heart, but blinded, (NOTE_23:1_13) that canot perceiue ye good wil of god: a soule, (PB_32) but deade & estraunged from the life of God. (NOTE_23:1_14)"
A19277,151,23,1,49,"And for this cause God is saide, to raise vs from the deade, that Christ may giue vs light, & that by his mighty operation through faith in him."
A19277,152,23,1,50,"It is his mighty operation, (NOTE_23:1_15) not mans weaknesse, to raise vs from sinne: For sathan is stronger then we, (NOTE_23:1_16) & holdeth vs (once dead) eue at his wil, as Paul saith, so as it is not possible for vs, to arise from his boos, til our life Christ, which is ye stroger, (NOTE_23:1_17) enter combat with him, bind him, & take vs (his spoile) away from him."
A19277,153,23,1,51,"The workeman then to raise vs in this first resurrection, is not man, but God."
A19277,154,23,1,52,"And he vseth heereto (as his finger to forme vs anewe) his worde & his spirite, & both from him selfe: that he might haue the whole glorie of our life."
A19277,155,23,1,53,"Embrace then this holy meanes, come to ye word, there is his spirit."
A19277,156,23,1,54,"If thou be his he will drawe thée to it, lighten thée by them, & raise thée from this spirituall death, as the Apostle hath saide, (NOTE_23:1_18) If the spirite of him that raised vp Iesus from the deade dwell in you, hee that raised vp Christ from the deade, shall also quicken your mortall bodies, because that his spirite (PB_33) dwelleth in you."
A19277,157,23,1,55,"Nowe what this resurrection is, the Apostle doth tel vs: namely, newnesse of life, saying: (NOTE_23:1_19) We are buried then with Christ by baptisme into his death, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by ye glorie of the father: so wee should walke in newnesse of life."
A19277,158,23,1,56,"This is then ye first resurrection: namely, newnes of life."
A19277,159,23,1,57,There must be life (beloued) as well in the spirite as in the bodie.
A19277,160,23,1,58,"Manie men séeme to liue, & to doe the works of life, but not in the spirite, but in the body: to serue their turn, to answere the law, to obserue the time, but all this while the spirite liueth not."
A19277,161,23,1,59,"Many a papist to day will come to Church in bodie, but he bringeth a deade soule with him: for Christian Religion hath no roume in his heart."
A19277,162,23,1,60,"But if thou wilt haue thy part (Papist or Protestant) in the first resurrection, thou must beginne to liue in thy spirite, that thy spirite may enforce thy bodie, to loue, liue, & feare thy God."
A19277,163,23,1,61,"According to this sentence of Paule: (NOTE_23:1_20) Cast off the olde man, which is corrupt through the deceiueable lustes, & bee yee renewed in the spirite of your minde, & put (PB_34) on the newe man, which after God is created in righteousnesse & true holynesse."
A19277,164,23,1,62,"And at one worde to speake it, herein consisteth the first resurrection: To cast away the works of darkenesse, & to put on, Christ the armour of light."
A19277,165,23,1,63,"But, as no man raised from a filthy puddle, will willingly beare with him the myerie spots of that dirtie soile, but will rather cast away the defyled garments that he might appeare clensed: (NOTE_23:1_21) Euen so (beloued) wee must not part stakes with God & sinne, but we must say to sinne, get thée hence by a spirituall hatred vnto her, & so increase in it, that we must (as the Apostle Iude saith) euen hate the very garment that is polluted by the fleshe. (NOTE_23:1_22)"
A19277,166,23,1,64,"So must we (hauing receiued such grace) liue in spirite & bodie, as the sonnes of lighte, translated from the power of death, to the kingdome of Christ in all peace, (NOTE_23:1_23) Godlynes, (NOTE_23:1_24) sobrietie & honestie."
A19277,167,23,1,65,"Thus shal we liue, & raigne wt Christ, a thousand yeare, viz. for euer."
A19277,168,23,1,66,"Now call your spirites to your senses, & sée howe yée sauour this trueth, (beloued in Christ) Rowse vppe your drowsie heartes & (PB_35) with the perspicuitie of a good conscience, sifte & search your selues euerie one, howe you haue profited by this doctrine, & whether you liue or die."
A19277,169,23,1,67,"Be not deceiued, God is not mocked: whatsoeuer a man soweth, that shall hée reape."
A19277,170,23,1,68,"For, if yée sowe still to the flesh, your former corruptions, you shal reape the seconde death."
A19277,171,23,1,69,"But if nowe, you can take hold of Christs doctrin, by his spirit, & from his truth sowe to your spirits, ye séeds of ye word of Faith, of righteousnes of peace, & godlynesse, (NOTE_23:1_25) you are partakers then of ye first resurrection & shal reape hereof, life euerlasting."
A19277,172,23,1,70,"And in this examination, two sorts of men, are meruellously conuinced."
A19277,173,23,1,71,"The first, neither féeling death or life in god, runneth headlong to his luste, in infidelitie & gréedinesse to sinne: as though that onely were his chiefe beatitude."
A19277,174,23,1,72,"And these bée the Atheistes of our dayes, whose consciences are seared vppe with an hotte yron, so, as no worde can pearce into their heartes, or sappe of Gods spirite haue course in their members, but are past all féeling, euen at the point of damnation."
A19277,175,36,0,0,"The seconde sort, are of such, as hauing some sparkes, of a former fire, & a little breathing force of an elder strength, (but nowe decaying) doe yet séeme to liue: when rather it may be feared, that they are almost deade."
A19277,176,36,0,1,And these are notably shadowed vnto vs by ye Church of Sardi in the Apocalips. (NOTE_36:0_0)
A19277,177,36,0,2,"And writte vnto the Angel (.i. the Minister) of the Church which is at Sardi: These things saith he, that hath the seuen spirites of God in his hand, & the 7 stars, I knowe thy workes: for thou hast a name that thou liuest, but thou art deade."
A19277,178,36,0,3,Oh (beloued) marke well this Church of Sardi or Lidia.
A19277,179,36,0,4,"She is not an idolatrous Church, but professing God & godlinesse."
A19277,180,36,0,5,"She hath the forme of Gods gouernement, his worde, his ministers, & is called his Church."
A19277,181,36,0,6,"She séemeth for her outward shew, to be most Christian & holy: but in déede & troth, shee is conuicted of death."
A19277,182,36,0,7,"And that not because shée hath no part of godly life in her, but because she hath fallen fro her first loue, life, & strength in him, that holdeth ye manifold graces (called 7, spirits) in his hande, to dispose at his good pleasure, & (PB_37) the sufficient number of his preachers, named starres, to shine into the darkenesse of mans nature, with the brightnesse of his word."
A19277,183,36,0,8,"Finally, Sardi is conuinced, yt she is imperfect in her workes before God: that is, she was but an hypocriticall Church, rested in the externall ceremonies & rites, but sought not the Lorde, in trueth & sinceritie."
A19277,184,36,0,9,"And héere note, beloued, that whatsoeuer Church, or people, which hath not in her soule, the rooted faith of Christ, graft by his spirite, in that inner Man, in strength wherof, the force & power of Christs spirite floweth thence, into an open practise of holinesse & godlinesse, righteousnesse & honestie: That same Church, people, or seuered person is as deade before the Lord."
A19277,185,36,0,10,"But yet in this Church of Lidia, there were a fewe names, as ye Lord noteth in the 4 of ye 3 which had not defiled their garments: yt is, had not stained ye profession of Christ, which Christ, they by baptism, had put on & is ye wedding garment, adorning our beauty in him, & couereth our infirmities & iniquities, from ye censure of gods iustice."
A19277,186,36,0,11,"Very comfortable is (PB_38) this to the Godly, but to ye wicked most terrible."
A19277,187,36,0,12,"The Lordes eyes beholde the hearts & actes of men, & doth daily discerne the number of the Godly: but kéepeth recordes of the wickeds practizes, against the day of wrath."
A19277,188,36,0,13,"O Englande, Englande, Oh thou Church of Sardi, if thou be looked into with a spirituall eye, thou shalt be founde néere vnto death: onely a fewe names or persons are kept in thée, for a reserued séed to the Lorde."
A19277,189,36,0,14,"In outwarde shew, what Church more holy Thy Princes are protestants: Thy angelical starres, thy bishops & preachers, are learned teachers Thy gouernement is godly, thy profession is holy: But (O Englande) if thou be sounded to the heart, thou shalt be founde (I feare me) verie sicke & néere vnto death."
A19277,190,36,0,15,"Many maladies haue mette with thée, no sickenesse, but hath taken holde of thée, & sore weakened thy strength: But last of al, hypocrisie & securitie sléepe in thy bosome."
A19277,191,36,0,16,"Thou stainest thy bright vesture of holy profession with the filthy spottes of carnall desires: Thy religion, is a cloake to all thy iniquities."
A19277,192,36,0,17,"But as a spot is soone espied, (PB_39) & séemeth most foule in a scarlet robe: So the brighter thy profession is, the sooner thy sinnes are discouered, & thine imperfections more notorious."
A19277,193,36,0,18,"But by two especiall notes, a sicke man is knowne to be neare his death."
A19277,194,36,0,19,"First, his pulses labour weakely, his speech draweth farrely, & his strength is fled away: Secondly when he is sodeinely bereft of his vitall spirits & perfect senses, so as he is not féeling ye parts of his dying bodie, he is déemed neare vnto his death."
A19277,195,36,0,20,"Alas, looke into the bodie of England, for the soundenes of her life, Christ in her & beholde, her pulses beate faintly, her speach fetcheth farly, her strength is meruellously decayed."
A19277,196,36,0,21,"Is her zeale to religion, as it was in the beginning of her maiesties raigne Is it continually vigent in all the parts of the bodie doth euery knée bowe to Christ the Lorde in her doth euery tongue confesse Iesus to be the Lorde, to the glorie of God the father Nay, (alas) this little life left, is drawne néere to the heart, & the heart is verie sicke."
A19277,197,36,0,22,"A fewe names, a fewe, in respecte of so great a number."
A19277,198,36,0,23,"What meaneth it, yt so many magistrates are (PB_40) molested with carcke against conspiracies & domesticall furies That such & so great vices, are dayly spread, & breake out So sundrie persons forced, wt papists filthy familyes & popish seminaries Such friendshippe to Gods enimies of some, that rather should help to spewe them out of the bodie Such prouision for warre such feare of forraine foes & so small trust in manie home dwellers vndoubtedly, this is the very cause, that Englande is very sicke, fainting & falling, as by degrées, from her former strength in Christ."
A19277,199,36,0,24,"Religion is thought to bee strong ynough of it selfe: for aide it can obtaine little, except about the heart."
A19277,200,36,0,25,"Godly conuersation is fledde out of the countrie, God graunt him godly, & constant entertainment in her graces Court."
A19277,201,36,0,26,Charity is become key cold: for no man hath leasure to loue beyonde himselfe.
A19277,202,36,0,27,"Hate of iniquitie is banished the lande, & the true loue of God is hardly to be founde, in the bodie of England."
A19277,203,36,0,28,"Euen now is performed againe the prophet Hosias speach: There is no truth nor mercy, (NOTE_36:0_1) nor knowledge of God in ye land: by swearing, & lying, & (PB_41) killing, & stealing, & whoring, they breake out, & bloode toucheth blood: therefore shall the lande mourne & And are we not senselesse of our weake estate Do not our spirituall preachers crie vnto vs (NOTE_36:0_2) There is no health fro top to ye toe."
A19277,204,36,0,29,"All haue gone astray, euery ma after his picked & chose way: ye long suffering of God, hath béene to drawe you to repentance, but you haue abused his great pacience, & are like to the raging seas: for in ye glory of your presumptios, you haue cast vp to the eyes of ye Lord, the filthie fome of your bloodgiltinesse."

A19277,213,36,0,38,"But of ye residue, what shal we say truly we may rightly say as God him selfe spake to his prophet Ezechiel, in ye time, saying: Also thou son of man, the childre of thy people, ye talke of thee by the wals (as they sit at their banquets, (NOTE_36:0_7) yu art their sauce to their delicates) & in the dores of their houses, & whe they sit in the streets to recreate theselues, & speake one to an other, saying: (in derisio of my law) come I pray you, & heare what is ye word yt cometh from the Lorde: for they come vnto thee, as the people vseth to come, & my people sit before thee, & heare thy words, but they wil not do the: for with their mouths they make (mowes & ) iestes & their hart* goeth after their couetousnes."
A19277,214,36,0,39,"And lo, Thou art to them, as a iesting song, of one that hath a pleasant voice, & can sing well: for they heare thy words, but they do the not."
A19277,215,36,0,40,"And when this cometh (PB_43) to pas (for lo, it wil come) (namely ye ripenes of this sin, & the performance of my prophets threts fro me) Then shal they knowe, (NOTE_36:0_8) yt (not a iesting singer but) a prophet hath ben amongst them."

A19277,223,36,0,48,"Nay, if we might haue but the fourth part, & that on the Sabboth onely, it were in these partes a vertuous people."
A19277,224,36,0,49,"And after our hearing, howe do we digest the worde For the moste part, this is al: At dinner, & after, we talke of the man, but féede not of the matter: We either yéelde him his due commendation, or our dislike: But euen as minstrels song once hearde, is streight forgotten: So very fewe, with Marie, laieth vp in his heart, those things which the Prophet spake, Take héede that you spurne not at your Phisicions: for then your health is at an ende."

A19277,233,47,0,0," (PB_47) And now I perceiue this first parte hath taken my whole time allotted me, so as I can not speake of the seconde, which is so depending of the first, that well they can not bee disioyned."
A19277,234,47,0,1,"But in asmuch as your ciuill solemnities, aske more tyme, then possibly the forenoone woulde afforde vs, I will deferre my seconde part till some other time, except I receiue your pleasures, farther to procéede."
A19277,235,47,0,2,"Well then: knowing now your godly desires, by the harald at armes, that I shoulde procéede: Let vs read our second part, & it is thus:For on such the second death hath no power, (NOTE_47:0_0) but they shal be ye priestes of god & Christ, & shall raigne with him a thousand yeare."
A19277,236,47,1,0,"In this part (dearely beloued) the Euangelist doth by a most elegant phrase, describe the state & conditio of the faithfull, affirming the, so farre of to be once touched, after ye punct of natural death, with the paines of hell or false fained (PB_48) popish purgatorie, that contrarily, they presently are in blisse with God, singing with the spirits of ye iust, the due prayses of the Lord: saying, for on such."
A19277,237,47,1,1,"& But to the further openyng of this excellent part, let vs obserue these thrée thinges: First what is to be vnderstoode by this second death."
A19277,238,47,1,2,"Secondly, of what prerogatiue & power ye same is."
A19277,239,47,1,3,"And last of al, for a final conclusion, what, & wher is the ful felicitie of the iust, which haue their part in the first resurrection."
A19277,240,47,1,4,"The second death, (to be shorte) is that which followeth the firste, as a merite of his deserte."
A19277,241,47,1,5,"But death is said to be twofold, in the holy scriptures."
A19277,242,47,1,6,"For as there is a death of the body, so is there likewise a death of the soule."
A19277,243,47,1,7,"But of death of the bodie, we haue saide before: And of the naturall death, Gods holy booke, our common experience: & the dead body of this departed Christian before vs, beareth perfecte testimony."
A19277,244,47,1,8,"Of which the Apostle Paule sayth: It is decreed that man shall once die, & then cometh his iudgement."
A19277,245,47,1,9,"And our Apostle in this booke: (NOTE_47:1_0) Blessed are the dead, which die in the Lord: (or for the Lords cause) (PB_49) for they rest from their labours, so saith the spirite, & their works follow them."
A19277,246,47,1,10,"Their owne workes followe them, not the workes of other for them."
A19277,247,47,1,11,"And be it knowne vnto you yt the first death of ye soule, (which is sinne & iniquitie) is the verie cause procuring Gods iudgement, to strike the bodie with naturall death, & is héere called the first death of the body."
A19277,248,47,1,12,"For ye which, the soule, that dieth in sinne, shall abide much paine & torment in hel, when yet the body therof sléepeth quiet in the graue, expecting his woeful resurrection."
A19277,249,49,0,0,"And now of the second death, which Christ Iesus, (NOTE_49:0_0) & our Apostle Iohn calleth hell, & the lake of fire."
A19277,250,49,0,1,"Feare not the, saith Christ, which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soule: but rather feare him which is able to destroy both body & soule, into hel."
A19277,251,49,0,2,"Here is ye death of ye body, the first death & the death of the soule in hell, the second."
A19277,252,49,0,3,"Of the same seconde death, speaketh S. Iohn in this receiued text."
A19277,253,49,0,4,"Goe too, you worldlings, (NOTE_49:0_1) that treasure vp wrath to your selues, for the last day: tribulation & anguish, death & hell, shall be your portion."
A19277,254,49,0,5,"Looke to this (PB_50) you scorners yt put far off the last day, here is to you endles woe."
A19277,255,49,0,6,"You haue made a couenant with death, but death it selfe & hell, viz. the damned soules in them, shall henceforth be cast both bodie & soule, into the burning lake of fire & brimston, which is the second death."
A19277,256,49,0,7,"For be the day neuer so long, at the last cometh Euening."
A19277,257,49,0,8,"Oh, beloued that wéepe nowe, then shall you laugh & reioyce, if so that you kisse & embrace the Sonne of God, & fal before his presence, condening your selues for sin, & killing sinn in you, by ye power of his spirit you shal the sée ye proud antechristia Pharaoh, & al his popish Egyptias, cast into ye sea & gulfe of vnquenchable fire, when your selues, by your mighty Moses & captain christ, shall be ledd into the heauenly lande of promise, there to raigne wt him for euer & euer."
A19277,258,49,0,9,"Many men mooue much dispute about the site & place of hell, this firie lake: But I say onely this of it: It is a forbidden curiositie, engendring strife, deuoide of profit, to question where, & in what place it is: But it is a commanded diuinitie, to séeke the liuing God, with reuerent feare, by his mercie, & (PB_51) Christes merite to be raunsomed from the paines & power thereof."
A19277,259,49,0,10,"Of whose power, we thus say: The second death (which is hell) hath a double power or prerogatiue."
A19277,260,49,0,11,The first is a prerogatiue to receiue such persons as of right doe belong vnto her.
A19277,261,49,0,12,"The seconde is, perpetually to kéepe their soules in that lake, till the day of iudgement, & can neither be coniured or commaunded to deliuer any one of them (or can they come out of her) by any authoritie or power, of Pope or whole papasie: but after that day, shall possesse both the bodies & souls of ye malignant Church, to her euerlasting tormentes."
A19277,262,49,0,13,"Nowe, what soules & persons, doe belong to her, our Apostle doth tel vs, in the 21 of this book, saying: But the fearefull & vnbeleeuing, & the abhominable, (NOTE_49:0_2) & murtherers, & whormongers, & idolaters & sorcerers, & al liers, shal haue their part in ye lake, which burneth with fire & brimsto, which is the second death."
A19277,263,49,0,14,"Thrée sortes of persons Gods spirit doeth assure vs, to be vnder the power of ye second death."
A19277,264,49,0,15,"That is: ye obstinate Infidell, the fearefull Papiste, & the abhominable (PB_52) couetous of the worlde: as drunkards whoremongers, murtherers, couetous, liars & such like."
A19277,265,49,0,16,"Delicate be your delightes, yee gallants of these dayes, but wisely call them to account, before the mourners followe the sinfull corps to the graue. (NOTE_49:0_3)"
A19277,266,49,0,17,"For if the Lord (which is the searcher of the heart) find your delights with death to end in infidelitie, in fearefull poperie, or in any these carnal abhominations, the deceiue not your selues: for the prerogatiue of the second death, may not be taken fro her."
A19277,267,49,0,18,"God is a iust God, (NOTE_49:0_4) & in his iustice, will iudge euery ma according to the verie nature of his worke."
A19277,268,49,0,19,"Note here also, yt ciuill honestie, without Christs diuinitie, cannot kéepe the honest Infidel, & vnbeléeuer, from the second death."
A19277,269,49,0,20,"For we possesse ye heauens, by inheritance onely, & we are none otherwise made heires, the by this prerogatiue, that we are made the sons of God. (NOTE_49:0_5)"
A19277,270,49,0,21,"And wee are none otherwise made the sones of God, but by our faith in Iesus Christ."
A19277,271,49,0,22,"Nor can this faith bée else obtained, but by the spirite of God."
A19277,272,49,0,23,"Or doth this spirit otherwise (ordinarily) worke it in vs, then by the preaching (PB_53) of the word of God."
A19277,273,49,0,24,"But, the infidell reiecteth the worde: (NOTE_49:0_6) & therefore Gods spirite: likewise our Christ, & in him, our heauenly father, & so finally, this heauenly inheritance."
A19277,274,49,0,25,"And as for our honest life & good workes, they serue, but so seale vp the heartes of the faithfull, to thassuraunce of their election, & to procure others, to prayse the Lorde, being benefited by them, in vs."
A19277,275,49,0,26,"But the onely hand that apprehendeth our inheritance in Christ, is our firme fixed faith in him, beléeuing by his word & spirit, in the full consent of our hartes, that he is the same, which the most mercifull father hath giuen him to be to vs: That is, our wisedome, our iustification, our holynesse, our frée & most absolute redemption: (NOTE_49:0_7) & so in the bottome of our heartes, doe by faith embrace him."
A19277,276,53,0,0,"2 The second sort subiect vnto hel, are the feareful papistes, who shal neuer (so dying) escape ye second death."
A19277,277,53,0,1,"And if you will marke with me this Epitheton, fearefull: & therewith measure in truth, the popish profession: you must of méere necessitie grant me, that no papist (dying (PB_54) in his popery) can be else where placed but in the second death."
A19277,278,53,0,2,"And to your better vnderstading hereof, you must distinguish betwixt feare & feare: for there is a feare, comended & comanded to vs, in ye holy scriptures, (NOTE_53:0_0) as: The feare of the Lord is ye beginning of wisedom: comanded, (NOTE_53:0_1) Serue ye Lorde in feare, & reioyce to him with trebling."
A19277,279,53,0,3,"Again, Feare god, honor the king, (NOTE_53:0_2) loue brotherly fellowship."
A19277,280,53,0,4,"But this is yt feare, which Gods spirite planteth in his children, to serue him in his true worship, & is euer ioyned, wt assured knowledge, & affiance in God."
A19277,281,53,0,5,"And in ye knot of christia mariage, (NOTE_53:0_3) this sacred feare is rightly shadowed: for ye wife feareth to offend her husband, but it is for reuerece & loue to him, & neuer wtout affiance of his fauor, because she knoweth him, to be her maried husband: So likewise ye godly child, doth feare to displease his father, not bicause he doubteth of his loue, but for yt he would not gréeue ye spirit of his life, who he feleth most assuredly in natural knot, fast tyed to him."
A19277,282,53,0,6,"And though his father lend him a frowning face, he knows yt those his lookes proceed of fatherly loue, to his correctio."
A19277,283,53,0,7,"wherof (PB_55) persuaded, so he feareth, so he trusteth, so he naturally loueth & obeieth him."
A19277,284,53,0,8,"And this knowledge & loue driueth away filthy feare, which gendreth painefulnes."
A19277,285,53,0,9,"But the feare yt Iohn speaketh of, is flat contrarie to this."
A19277,286,53,0,10,"It is begotten by distrust in god, it is borne of ignorance, it liueth to dispaire, & dieth in gret painfulnes."
A19277,287,53,0,11,"what other is ye whole profession of popery, but méere timiditie They euer distrust god of his promise, during their life, & therefore they die in feare of his fauor, at ye houre of death."
A19277,288,53,0,12,"If he say: That soule yt sinneth shal die, they beleue him not, but walke fro sin to sin, committing more trust to a Popes bul, the credit to ye immortal word of god."
A19277,289,53,0,13,"If ye Lord say, & sweare also: Verely, verely, (NOTE_53:0_4) he that heareth my words, & beleueth in him yt sent me, hath euerlasting life, & shall not come into condenatio: but hath passed fro death to life."
A19277,290,53,0,14,"yet ye papist is afraid to rest vpo this promise: for he doth not absolutely beléeue it, but is in feare notwtstanding, yt after death, his soule shal go to condemnation, if not to hell, yet at the least to purgatory."
A19277,291,53,0,15,"Though the spirit of God say, There is no condenation to the (PB_56) that are graft in Christ Iesu: whose life is not after ye flesh, but after the spirit: yet the papist, wil not beleeue, yt he ought to be assured of this Christian rocke, to rest vpon: but casteth himselfe into the raging sea of wauering distrust."
A19277,292,53,0,16,"Which feareful persuasion, hath béene the very building of al Abbies, priories, & popish paultries, from many yeres past vs, & doth bréede great blasphemie to the glorie of God."
A19277,293,53,0,17,"For first it taketh away the foundation of our faith, in the merite of Christ, which is, ye God almighty is become our father in him, & yt he is nowe well pleased with vs, & as a father, not onely doeth pardon our sins, but so tenderly loueth vs, yt our necessities whatsoeuer, he carefully helpeth."
A19277,294,53,0,18,"It taketh away also this holy boldnes in loue, which his spirit doeth assure vs of, & Christ doeth teach vs to cry vnto him: (NOTE_53:0_5) O thou yt art our father."
A19277,295,53,0,19,Secondly the popish doubtfulnes taketh away ye benefite of Christ his sonne.
A19277,296,53,0,20,"For we are taught to beleue, ye Christ is dead, for vs, that he is ye lambe of God, which taketh away our sinnes, that nothing can condene vs, because our Christ hath iustified (PB_57) vs, & is deade, risen againe, & set at the right hand of God, for vs, so that in him, we that truely beléeue, are more then conquerours: so as neither hell or heauen, man or Angel, prince or diuell, things present or to come, can separate vs, from our benefite, & loue of Christ."
A19277,297,53,0,21,"This certaintie the booke of God doth teach vs: but from this anchorholde, the diuell & poperie, laboureth to drawe vs."
A19277,298,53,0,22,"Thirdly it taketh all godly consolation from vs, in the day of tentation, & layeth vs open to Sathans iawes."
A19277,299,53,0,23,"For who can lift vp his heart, in tentation, that fighting with his enimy much stronger the he, hath no hope of his captaine Christ, the strongest of all, or in the mercie of God, to defende him It also taketh away ardent & earnest prayer to God: for who can with comfort crie in triall, that standeth in feare he shall not be hearde but in the ende he falleth into dispaire & hate of God, to all loosenesse of life, & ruffianlike boldnes, taking lust to liue in sinne, not expecting other then hell at the ende."
A19277,300,53,0,24,"Laste of all, the popish doctrine of doubtfulnesse fighteth flat against the nature of our Christian (PB_58) faith: which is not a light opinion of our God, & Christ his loue to vs, & our saluation in him: but a most firme, stable & sure foundation setled in our soules: so, as neither fire in earth, nor powers in hell, can burne or raze it out of our heartes, that wee are sealed by his spirite, in the faith of his Christ, (NOTE_53:0_6) to be his children, & fellowe heires with our eldest brother Christ our Lorde, in his great loue, wherwt he hath loued vs, yea, euen when we were his enimies."
A19277,301,53,0,25,"Wherefore we are taught that bee faithfull, (NOTE_53:0_7) to holde this for most certaine: that though wee be wicked of our selues, yet are wee iustified by his grace, in our faith, & haue peace with God, & frée accesse in one spirite, to God our father nowe, & shalbe receiued to him of Angels, when we departe this life, as this our text doth also tell vs."
A19277,302,53,0,26,"Hell shall not touch vs, but we shall raigne with God, his priestes, & holy ones for euer."
A19277,303,53,0,27,"Cast off popish fearefulnesse therfore, & acquaint your selues wt the hearing of ye word of God: so shal yée learne, to be firme in faith & sure to liue."
A19277,304,53,0,28,"Here be touched also, all those, which (PB_59) feare men rather then God, & in time of persecution runne from religion, or in the presece of popish princes, iudges, tormentours, or before a balde Masse-priest, dare not confesse the Lorde: but to saue his momentary life, doth cast away the eternall."
A19277,305,53,0,29,"Hee that will saue his life, shall lose it: (NOTE_53:0_8) & he that shal lose his life for my sake & the gospels, shall saue it, saith our sauiour Christ."
A19277,306,53,0,30,"Pray, pray: pray the Lorde to pull you out of poperie (beloued) & in speede, come out of Babilon, (NOTE_53:0_9) which is appointed to be cast into the fierie lake, least being partakers of her sinnes, yée also féede of her plagues."
A19277,307,53,0,31,"The thirde sort which shall to hell, are the abhominable murtherers, harlots, & such like."
A19277,308,53,0,32,"These abhominable are to be vnderstoode of such persons, as, hauing once professed the trueth of God, are now, not onely become to hate it, but most filthily they blaspheme it, persecute & torment those, that professe it, to whom is reserued fire & brimstone. (REF0) (REF1)"
A19277,309,53,0,33,"The rest, are so manifest, as néede no commentarie: onely let vs knowe, that murtherers be they, which kill, wound or hurt, (PB_60) themselues or their neighbours, either with the sworde of an hateful heart, (NOTE_53:0_10) (as Iohn saith) or with the sharpned tongue (as Dauid saith) or with the hande, as Caine did his brother Habell. (NOTE_53:0_11)"
A19277,310,53,0,34,"And forget not that the seconde death, is the receptacle for all such as die impenitent hereof."
A19277,311,60,0,0," (PB_60) The seconde parte of deathes power in hell is, fast to retaine her captiues, from the houre of their death with Diues, vntil the day of the last resurrectio: which thing is most plainely proued by the storie of Diues & Lazarus. (NOTE_60:0_0)"
A19277,312,60,1,0,"Nowe (beloued) the papists graunt with vs, that in the hels there is no redemption: but they say, that in the earth there are distinct, thrée sorts of me: One sort most holy, another sort most wicked & the thirde sort of a certain mixture, neither so holy, as straight vpon death they demerite to goe to heauen, or yet so wicked, as at all they can be sent to hell, but are for a time, committed after death, vnto the paines of Purgatorie, & must thence bée delyuered, not by mercie, but by merite of Masses (dirtie) diriges, popes (paltries called) pardons, (PB_61) & such like."
A19277,313,60,1,1,"And here is your foundation, & your cause of prayer for the deade."
A19277,314,60,1,2,"In aunswere wherof we graunt: some persons are so sanctified in earth, that straight from hence they goe to heauen, but not for any their merite: For they are taught to holde, that hauing done all they can: (NOTE_60:1_0) yet they are none other but wasting & vnprofitable seruauntes."
A19277,315,60,1,3,"And that some are so wicked, that straight they goe to hell, as all obstinate, rebellyous & trayterous papistes, feareful wretches, & abhominable persons, we firmely beléeue."
A19277,316,60,1,4,"But, that there are any so imperfect, that for their imperfection, they are stayed from heauen, & for their remnant of holynesse, cannot come to hell, & therefore of necessitie must tumble into a popish purgatorie, this we flatly affirme to be a foolish opinion, without warrant from God."
A19277,317,60,1,5,"And touching these mixed persons, surely the Church neither hath had, or shall haue any other."
A19277,318,60,1,6,"Of women: was not that most holy maide, Marie, the blessed mother of Christ, one most sacred (NOTE_60:1_1) But both the holy scriptures, & her owne confession (PB_62) conuinceth her of sinne, but she is saued by her Christ, (NOTE_60:1_2) saying: My spirit doth reioyce in God my sauiour."
A19277,319,60,1,7,"And for her daily sinnes, she, as al other, is taught to pray: forgiue vs our sinnes."
A19277,320,60,1,8,"So also, in her blessed bodie, was sure faith, great loue, a pure heart, & much godlynesse, wherefore beholde a certaine mixture."
A19277,321,60,1,9,"Also of men: the Apostles were the most pure, & yet not without the bodies of sinne."
A19277,322,60,1,10,"What else moueth Paul, to crie to the Romans: (NOTE_60:1_3) O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from ye body of this death And this our most holie Iohn, in his first Epistle, doth accuse himselfe, (NOTE_60:1_4) & all other Apostles, of sin, saying: If we say yt we haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues, & Thus they liued, & thus they dyed with this battel against sinne, but had victorie in Iesus Christ."
A19277,323,60,1,11,"Yet I trow, yt the papistes will not say: how the gratious virgin Mary & the holy Apostles, went from death, to their popish purgatorie. (NOTE_60:1_5)"
A19277,324,60,1,12,"The same mixture, yt is to say, in one bodie, to haue obeying faith, & in it another lawe rebelling to the spirite, is in all the electe of God, in more or lesse measure."
A19277,325,60,1,13,"By meanes (PB_63) whereof, there cannot but bee many sharpe battels, in the hearte of man, so, as some times, he slippeth & is brought very low, & somtimes he resteth againe & taketh courage, & stoutly standeth vnder the banner, of his captain Christ, by the strength of his holy spirite: but yet at the houre of death, if he shoulde be measured, by his falls, he should be iudged worthy of the second death. (NOTE_60:1_6)"
A19277,326,60,1,14,"But because he hath his part (by true & louing Faith, in repentance) of the first resurrection, he dyeth blessed in the Lord, & holy, resteth from his labours in earth, & paines in hell: for, the second death hath no power of him, much lesse can a popish purgatorie, which is not."
A19277,327,60,1,15,"I come not to dispute with the papistes nowe, but to lay forth the plaine doctrine of saluation, to your Christian hearts, & something to let you sée the blindnes of ye side, which in so cléere a light do grope at their owne inuentions."
A19277,328,60,1,16,But to your purgatory thus much: Is there such a place yea sir.
A19277,329,60,1,17,"I pray you wher sir, haue you warrant for it in the holy scriptures Forsooth saith the papist, both in the olde Testament, & in the newe."
A19277,330,60,1,18,"(PB_64) doth not Zacharie say: (NOTE_60:1_7) I haue loosed my prisoners out of the pitte wherein is no water Sir, here is our purgatory."
A19277,331,60,1,19,Well proued: & like the rest of all your religion.
A19277,332,60,1,20,"Héere is metion made of a pitte voide of water, & that is ynough for purgatories proofe."
A19277,333,60,1,21,"Such warrant haue they, for the assumption of their Lady, hauing no warrant for it, in their blasphemous Masse, of that day they solemnely sing the Gospel, of Marie & Martha."
A19277,334,60,1,22,"But this is ynough to blinde the eyes of the ignorant, that they haue the name of Marie, in that Masse, although it concerne a farre other matter, & be altogether spoke of another person."
A19277,335,60,1,23,"And euen such is the popish beggerie of this rich place, & promise of Gods prophet here."
A19277,336,60,1,24,"But be it that this scripture did any whitte toote at your purgatorie: I pray you sir, hath your purgatorie neither fire nor water in it you sée, water is here denied, & here is no mention of fire at all."
A19277,337,60,1,25,"Besides, the deliuerie here is saide to be, by the Lorde in heauen, & that in his mercy, without their merite: But out of your purgatorie, mens soules are deliuered (PB_65) by men: in earth, without him in heauen, through their merite (to his iustice) of prayer & almes, & diriges, & restles masses, & such like, & not by his mercie."
A19277,338,60,1,26,"And for the proofe hereof, you cite this place: (NOTE_60:1_8) He shall not come out thence, till hee hath paide the vtmost farthinge."
A19277,339,60,1,27,"If this sentence serue your purpose, then this doctrin, is rightly gathered of it, that though all the papists in the worlde pray & crie, & launce themselues, (NOTE_60:1_9) with their forefathers the false priestes of Baal, till they cease to liue, yet their poore popish prisoner lyeth in the pitte still, but without fire or water, (it is sure, some driefatte) till he hath payed, & not prayed, the vtmost farthing."
A19277,340,60,1,28,"Thus (beloued) yée may sée what gaine the papistes haue got of this place, which they haue stollen from his true sense, to shadowe their shamefull briberie, & marchandize of mens soules in a faigned purgatorie."
A19277,341,60,1,29,"If it bée lawfull to allegorize this place, (NOTE_60:1_10) then this lake is rather the power of Satan, & the bloude of the couenaunt, is the death of the Lord Christ: who hath long since, before we were borne, purged vs, (PB_66) & thence deliuered vs, (NOTE_60:1_11) & hath translated vs into the kingdome of himselfe."
A19277,342,60,1,30,"And your owne doctour Hierome affirmeth, yt this lake is (not purgatory, but) hell it self."
A19277,343,60,1,31,"But ye true sense of the place is, an assurance of Gods hande to them of Ierusalem, for the couenant of his Christ, for whose sake hee hath nowe brought them from Babylons bondage."
A19277,344,66,0,0,"A second place, the papistes haue of the new Testament, & that is out of the (REF0) Euerie mans worke shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shalbe reuealed by the fire, & the fire shal trie euery mans worke, of what sort it is."
A19277,345,66,0,1,"And this place séemeth so flatte on their side, that néedes we must haue a purgatorie. (NOTE_66:0_0)"
A19277,346,66,0,2,"Truely, for all this, we must driue them to Virgil, & Pindarus, for Paul doth no whit helpe them."
A19277,347,66,0,3,"And (good Christian auditorie) measure their opinion, by this scripture, & you shall sée howe falsely they father their purgatorie hereof."
A19277,348,66,0,4,"Héerein is mention of fire, I graunt: But such is this fire, yt not the persons yt do work gold or stubble, but ye work wrought shalbe cast into it: For he saith, & the fire shal trie euerie (PB_67) mans worke, & but they are to proue a place of fire, wherein the workman for his worke, is to be cast, which thou seest cannot be this."
A19277,349,66,0,5,"Againe, they say no man shal come into their purgatorie, but ye mixed sort wherof we spake before: But Paul speaketh here, of such a fire, as vniuersally all must be tryed by."
A19277,350,66,0,6,"For he saith not, they which haue builded haye, woode or stubble only, shal be tryed there, but also they, which haue builded golde, siluer, & precious stones vpon the foudation: These good workme must yet goe through this fire, or at the least their workemanshippe: For hee saith, euery mans worke, & Further, the texte doth not saye, that this fire shall purge the worke from corruption, or chaunge it: as to make Haye become Golde Woode, Siluer stubble precious stones: But hée saith, it shall bee ignis probatorius, non Purgatorius, it shall onelye prooue & trye, what nature the mettall is off, not purge the person or his worke at all."
A19277,351,66,0,7,"Doe not yee sée, by this sounding & short sifting of their popishe follyes, with this portion of holye (PB_58) scripture, that the papists are sacrilegious robbers of God, & his scriptures I doubt not, but you doe."
A19277,352,66,0,8,"Adde to this, their owne doctors are of other iudgement, touching this fire."
A19277,353,66,0,9,"Chrisostome taketh it for hell fire: (NOTE_66:0_1) Hierome, for the fire at the last day, which shal then trie euery mans worke what it is: Gregorie a Pope of Rome, vnderstandeth it for the afflictions of this life: And auncient Ambrose interpreteth it of doctrine, which of al other is the néerest the mind of the Apostle."
A19277,354,66,0,10,"For, the Apostle speaketh only of preachers & their labours, which the fire of Gods iudgement shall make manifest at his appointed season, whether they haue preached with the grouds of Religion in truth, & taught other points of doctrine also, sincerely & soundly, in puritie of trueth, or more corruptly haue laide erronious opinions vpon the foundation of our faith."
A19277,355,66,0,11,"This was the Apostles purpose, so that if this fire shoulde be of purgatorie, then no man, but preachers, (protestantes & popish) shoulde come thither."
A19277,356,66,0,12,"Last of all, their transgressions coulde neuer in this fire bée forgiuen, but onely proued (PB_69) such as they were."
A19277,357,66,0,13,"But if they could haue so good happe, as there to bée purged, yet is mercie so shutte out of that purgatorie, that no prayer can obtaine remission of sinnes there, or any redemption, can bee had, till sufficient paines be paide in that scarrefire, & so by fire, the soule must bee purged."
A19277,358,66,0,14,"Some other places they bring out, for their purgatorie."
A19277,359,66,0,15,"As, (NOTE_66:0_2) that acte of Machabeus for the dead, who sent his siluer to pray for them, & is commended by ye abridgement."
A19277,360,66,0,16,"For answere heereto, I say, althoughe we shoulde graunt this Act consonant wt the word (which indéed, is most flat against it) yet, that he, in that corruption of the Churche, prayed for the dead, nothing shall it proue for your purgatorie, no more then the praiers of some auncientes before vs, for the dead, did, when as they dreamed, not of purgatorie, but thought onely of the resurrection, (NOTE_66:0_3) as Iudas doth in this place."
A19277,361,66,0,17,"But I say to this place, as some Lawyers vse to say: Truth may not be trodden vnderfoote with a counterfaite showe."
A19277,362,66,0,18,"Of the weakenes of this booke, the Papistes themselues sufficiently (PB_70) knowe, & he that is ignorant thereof, let him read Kemnisius against the Tridentine councel in his Historia Purgatorii, 20 sess."
A19277,363,66,0,19,"8 I will no longer detaine you (good people) in these purgatorie matters: onely I tell you, such warrant hath all the rest of their profession, for their imagined purgatory, out of which they say mens soules shal once come, but they know not when."
A19277,364,66,0,20,"No, no, the seconde death is the onely receptacle of them, that goe not to heauen, where they shalbe holden remedilesse vntill the last resurrection."
A19277,365,66,0,21,And this is the power of the second death.
A19277,366,66,0,22,"Against this the papistes also say, that after life there is forgiuenesse of sinnes, to this mixed companye, which is obtained by their friendes, & merites of the Church, for them."
A19277,367,66,0,23,"But (beloued) this is their dreame against the trueth of the scripture, & the iudgementes of their best doctours, both which affirme plainely, that after naturall death, there is no remission of sinnes to the departed."
A19277,368,66,0,24,"Wherfore Dauid (in his life time) prayeth, (NOTE_66:0_4) O Lorde stay thine anger from mee, that I may recouer my strength before I (PB_71) goe hence, & be not."
A19277,369,71,0,0," (PB_71) The parable of the wise, (NOTE_71:0_0) & foolishe virgin, is set downe of Christ to proue this."
A19277,370,71,0,1,"& howe fareth it with them The wiser sort take Oyle with them: They loue, & liue a Christian life, while they haue time in this world, & therefore their owne workes doe follow them: & present themselues, as a witnesse to the parties faith, & are crowned with mercie: Come yee blessed of my Father, when I was an hungrie, you fedde mee."
A19277,371,71,0,2,"But the foolishe Virgins, though of the same calling, Virgins, the same profession to beare the lampe: Yet, because they were carelesse of Gods holy spirite, & thereby had no lightes before men, of Godly labours in good woorkes (the true triall of a liuelye faith) but haue committed that vnto their friendes, for them."
A19277,372,71,0,3,"These (I say) wanting true obedience to GOD, who hath saide, (NOTE_71:0_1) Let your light so shine beefore men, that they seeing your good workes, may glorie your Father which is in Heauen, had a boundance of carnalitie, with them."
A19277,373,72,0,0," (PB_72) (NOTE_72:0_0) These their euill workes, as some went before, & some followed them, vnto Iudgmente: so, they (after life) coulde haue none other answere to their crie, (NOTE_72:0_1) (Lorde open to vs) but this: departe ye cursed, I know you not."
A19277,374,72,0,1,"As many of you, heere present, therefore, as longe after life: séeke the Lord while he is to be founde, before your naturall death."
A19277,375,72,0,2,"While ye haue the light (saith Christ our Lorde) walke in the light: For darknesse will come, wherein no man can walke."
A19277,376,72,0,3,"And his Apostle Paul saith, (NOTE_72:0_2) While wee haue time, let vs doe good to all men: but he saith, while we haue time, which time is, yt we possesse in this life, & not others for vs after it."
A19277,377,72,0,4,"To this doctrine the auncient writers subscribe their heartes, & haue left their handes wt vs, yea euen such fathers, as ye papists approue for saincts, & their writings equall to the holy scriptures."
A19277,378,72,1,0," (PB_72) And first touching the sentence of Dauid before cited, videlicet: Lorde staye thine anger from mee."
A19277,379,72,1,1,"& Ambrose (NOTE_72:1_0) saith, Qui enim hic non accipit, &"
A19277,380,72,2,0,"Truely he ye receiueth not forgiuenes (PB_73) of his sinnes, in this life, shall not bée there."
A19277,381,72,2,1,He shal not be there.
A19277,382,72,2,2,"Why for hee can not possibly come to eternall life, because life eternall dependeth vpon the forgiuenes of sinnes."
A19277,383,72,2,3,"And therfore Dauid prayed, Forgiue me Lorde, that I may bee comforted, before I goe hence."
A19277,384,72,2,4,Thus farre Ambrose.
A19277,385,72,2,5,"Hierome a priest of Rome, & one of the foure Euangelistes of that Synagogue, vpon the same text, writing vpon Esay, saith: (NOTE_72:2_0) He that whilest he heere liueth, Dum in hoc corpore viuit) hath not obteined forgiuenesse of his sinnes, but hath without such remission, departed this life, hee perisheth to God, & ceasseth to bee: although he continue to himself, in paine & tormentes."
A19277,386,72,2,6,"And as touching the seconde scripture: Dum tempus habemus, Hierome saith of it: This our present life, is the seede time for vs to sowe, whatsoeuer we wil (saith Hierome:) but when this life is passed, & gone from vs, then is the time of good working taken away also."
A19277,387,72,2,7,"Augustine saith hereof, In futuro solism est remuneratio, In the life to come there is onely recompence & condemnation: but in this life, our (PB_74) sinnes are either bounde vp or loosed."
A19277,388,72,2,8,"And that learned Cyprian saith expresly: When our departure shall be herehence, there is lefte no place for repentance or power of any satisfaction."
A19277,389,72,2,9,"No saith Augustine ad Hesichium: (NOTE_72:2_1) For in what state soeuer at the last day of mans life, death shall sinde him: in the same state & condition, the last day of the worlde, shall comprehende him."
A19277,390,72,2,10,"Quoniam qualis in die isto quisque moritur, talis in illo die iudicabitur: For in what case soeuer a man at his last day, shall die, in the same case & state, shall the Lord iudge him, at the great day."
A19277,391,72,2,11,"From all these places, & witnesses then (beloued) yee sée, that neither popish praier, Romishe masses, deadly diriges, friuolous almes, or paltrie pardons, paines in purgatorie, or popishe pardons can any whit alter the state & condition of the persons once dead: but such workes as they themselues caried with them, such shall they rise withall vnto their iudgement: whether lampes of louing faith, to the praise of God, or cressettes of corruption, to their owne condemnation."
A19277,392,72,2,12,"And thus I will conclude, (PB_75) with the spirite of Gods sentence, our best moderator, & so passe to the last braunch. (NOTE_72:2_2)"
A19277,393,72,2,13,"Maruell not at this (sayth Christe) for the houre shall come, in the which all that are in the graues, shall heare his voice: And they shall come forth, that haue done good vnto the resurrectio of life: But they that haue done euill, vnto the resurrection of condemnation."
A19277,394,72,2,14,"The same assurance of doctrine, Gods spirite, by Paul doeth deliuer vs saying: (NOTE_72:2_3) We must all appeare before the iudgement seate of Christe, that euery man may receiue the thinges which are done in his bodye, according to that hee hath done, whether it bee good or euill."
A19277,395,75,0,0,"Note well this doctrine, & amend your liues, rest not vppon the doubtfull doctrine, of poperie (O dearely bought children of GOD) but fixe your faith, in this absolute doctrine of sound warrant, which is yea, & amen Then here you may perceiue, that after death there is no temporarie prison, as Popish purgatorie but a perpetuall lake of fire, which is ye second death: And also, yt after this life, there is no remissio of sins to any (PB_76) that hath not obteined that grace, during this time of repentance."
A19277,396,75,0,1,"But euen in what state the soule departeth from the bodie, at the comming of death: euen vnchanged, hee retyreth to the same bodie at the last, for the déeds done by himselfe, & not for the workes of any other done after him: And to receiue his iudgement, whether through faith (in her fruites) vnto life, in Christ, or because of sinne & Sathan, to eternall death."
A19277,397,75,0,2,"This is the sound, & sure doctrine of our good God."
A19277,398,75,0,3,"But as for the gainefull & paineful preaching of poperie, & her purgatorie, as a most venemous Serpente, flée from it: that you may escape the seconde death, & be partakers of the felicitie of the iust, which our text saith, is this: For they shall bee the priestes of God & Christ, & shall raigne with him a thousande yeares."
A19277,399,76,0,0,"Cicero hath saide, that true beatitude or blessednesse consisteth of two partes: Namely, to be frée from al kinde of want & miserie: & so to abound in all goodnesse, that on no parte he néedeth to aske further."
A19277,400,76,0,1,"Surely this very (PB_77) happinesse shall come to all those, which be partakers of the first resurrection."
A19277,401,76,0,2,"First, they shall be frée from all woe & miserie, in the ende of their course: for the seconde death, shall haue no power of them."
A19277,402,76,0,3,"And they shall abounde in all felicitie: for they are blessed, & holy, & shall therefore raigne with Christ for euer more."
A19277,403,76,0,4,"And here againe (beloued) note with me, what it is, to be blessed & holy."
A19277,404,76,0,5,"Namely, to haue forgiuenes of our sinnes in Christes death: (NOTE_76:0_0) & by the same, to be purged & segregated from dead workes, to serue the liuing God. (NOTE_76:0_1)"
A19277,405,76,0,6,"Blessed are they (saith Dauid) whose iniquities are forgiuen, & whose sinnes are couered: blessed is the man to whome the Lorde doeth not impute sinne."
A19277,406,76,0,7,"And then againe note, who they be that are so blessed, by Gods censure here: marke it wel, & thou shalt sée it: Not they, that liue so vprightly, that God hath not any thing, to lay to their charges: for none such can be founde amongest the sonnes of men."
A19277,407,76,0,8,"For what is he, that liueth & sinneth not, yea, more then seauen times a day (NOTE_76:0_2) No flesh is righteous in Gods sight: for all haue (PB_78) sinned, (NOTE_76:0_3) all haue gone out of the way, euery man his seuered course: this, after this sinne, another, after that, & all are therefore depriued of the glory of God: (NOTE_76:0_4) All are taught to cry, We & our fathers haue sinned, wee haue done vniustly, but deale not with vs, O Lord, in thine anger, for then wee perishe: but in the multitude of thy mercies, haue thou mercie vpon vs, & forgiue vs our trespasses."
A19277,408,76,0,9,"And heerein consisteth the felicitie of the iust, that they haue féeling heartes of sinne, & penitent spirites for their transgressions: humbled soules, void of hypocrisie, before the Almightie God, confessing with teares, in great remorse & agonies, their heaps of corruptions, before him: Euen Marie Christes mother, the Apostles & all the foure electe of God."
A19277,409,76,0,10,"Then are these mixed persons (whome the Papistes make the thirde sorte, to goe to purgatorie) onely they which are blessed, & are the whole number of the electe."
A19277,410,76,0,11,"All which as they confesse them selues worthie the seconde death, because of Sinne, & no wayes can merite eternall life, because their beste workes (PB_79) are full of corruption: So they mightily triumphe ouer sinne, (NOTE_76:0_5) death & hell: because they are purged in the bloode of the lambe, (NOTE_76:0_6) & haue their garmentes made white, are pardoned, of their former sinnes, by faith, in hys bloode, & are sanctified vnto godlinesse."
A19277,411,76,0,12,"Yea, so long as they liue, they confesse: because they féele the burthen of sinne in them, but they reioyce in this felicitie, that his spirite worketh in them an ardent zeale, & burninge desire, to liue in godlinesse & honestie, according to such portion, as the Lord doeth giue them, in their parte of the first resurrection."
A19277,412,76,0,13,"And hee that seeth not this, nor hath the practise of the premisses, is blinde & hath forgotten the purgation of sinnes."
A19277,413,79,0,0,"Last of all, forget not, this our Apostle doth not say, Blessed is he, (NOTE_79:0_0) which hath perfection in the firste resurrection: but, blessed is hee, that hath hys part in the first resurrection."
A19277,414,79,0,1,"So as, though there bee in vs, yet the remnauntes of sinne, & we can not quite shake off, that which cleaueth so faste (PB_80) on, (NOTE_79:0_1) or fully créepe, from that burthen, that presseth so harde vpon vs: ( & therefore alwayes of this sort, that are before called mixt) yet that Mediocritie or mixture, can not sende vs to the second death, if we haue our part, in the firste resurrection."
A19277,415,79,0,2,But I would not leaue thy conscience to bare affirmations.
A19277,416,79,0,3,There be verie sounde reasons to drawe thy confidence to this comforte. (NOTE_79:0_2)
A19277,417,79,0,4,"The firste is, the great mercie & rich clemencie of God the father, whose mercie hath béene such towardes vs, that when wée were his enemies, through sinne, hee hath euen then reconciled vs to himselfe, by his grace: howe much more therefore nowe, shall he estéeme vs for his, & embrace vs with his armes of mercie, séeing, we being so reconciled, séeke for his spirite to dwell in his loue If hee from his wrath deliuered vs, whe we had no care of him: shal he not much more nowe deliuer vs, shew a parte thereof (which they say, is purgatorie) nowe that our chiefe desire is, to séeke after him: & doe lament, at the verie heart, that dayly we so grieue him by our sinne This I take to be Pauls (PB_81) comfort to vs, where he saith: But God setteth out his loue towardes vs, (NOTE_79:0_3) seeing that while we were yet sinners, Christe died for vs: much more then, being now iustified by his bloode, wee shall be saued from wrath, through him."
A19277,418,79,0,5,"For, if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his sonne: much more, being reconciled, wee shall be saued by his life."
A19277,419,81,0,0,"2 The seconde argument is of the absolute sacrifice of Christ, Gods sone, for vs."
A19277,420,81,0,1,"we cannot fall from naturall death, into popish purgatorie, which are graft into his death: for the same hath fully satisfied the iustice of God for vs, pacified his anger, & obteined vs eternall redemption. (NOTE_81:0_0)"
A19277,421,81,0,2,"For Christ also hath once suffered (saith Peter,) ye iust for the vniust, that he might (not sende vs to purgatorie, but) bring vs to God."
A19277,422,81,0,3,"And this Christ in his owne bodie, bare our sins, on the trée, (NOTE_81:0_1) that being deliuered from sinne (then of good consequent, from the rewarde of sinne, which is death) wee shoulde liue in righteousnesse: by whose stripes ( & not by popishe purgatories purging) we are soundly healed."
A19277,423,81,0,4,"(PB_82) The fathers wrath, in this sacrifice, is fully pacified: for he hath giuen vs twice warrant thereof, by his owne voyce, saing: (NOTE_81:0_2) This is my beloued sonne in whom I am well pleased."
A19277,424,81,0,5,"It resteth therefore, according to our heauenly fathers commaundement, that we onely heare, & beléeue him."
A19277,425,81,0,6,"No feare of death, or iudgement to hell, (much lesse to purgatorie) can come then to vs, which liue in the first resurrection by newnes of life."
A19277,426,81,0,7,"For the Lorde our redemer, hath payed the full price of our ransome, & is therefore our Lutron & Lutrosis, so as, the vttermost farthing is tendred to Gods iustice in his death, for mans sinne, not by petition of sparing, or bearing for day of further payment, (NOTE_81:0_3) but by his blood he hath paide himselfe once for all, a full & absolute price for our redemption, to his father, (NOTE_81:0_4) & hath therfore, triumphed on the crosse against principalities & powers, & hath taken vs, in his victorie from the handes of captiuitie, & translated vs into his grace, putting out the whole hand writing that was against vs."
A19277,427,81,0,8,"Totum Chyrographum, he hath taken away, the whole obligation, (PB_83) not parte of it, in discharge of our debts, that be graft in him."
A19277,428,81,0,9,"And therfore there can not remayne a remnaunt of redemption for our selues, in a popishe purgatorie: For, to suppose this, were the greatest iniurie that coulde be, to the blood of our full ransome Iesus Christ."
A19277,429,83,0,0,"Last of all, ye promise of Gods mouth which can not lie (whose wordes are alwayes yea, & shall be alwayes true, though heauen & earth runne together, to perfourme them) is a further assurance to the conscience, of the godly man, that hee shall passe from death, presently vnto life."
A19277,430,83,0,1,"For their purgatorie is (say they) but to punish those sinnes, which at a mans death, remaine vnpardoned, & not purged before."
A19277,431,83,0,2,"But to the penitent God saith thus: At what time so euer a sinner doeth repent him of his sinne, (NOTE_83:0_0) from the bottome of his heart, at that time will I (saith the Lord) I, (shall the Pope then punish) put all, ( & not part of) his wickednesse out of my remembraunce."
A19277,432,83,0,3,"And our sauiour Christ, (NOTE_83:0_1) hath promised vs (which is the author of trueth) He that beleeueth in me, yea, though he were deade, yet shal (PB_84) he liue."
A19277,433,83,0,4,"And he that beleueth in me, hath euerlasting life."
A19277,434,83,0,5,"Againe, that which aboue all other, is most plaine: Hee that beleueth in mee, (NOTE_83:0_2) shall not come into codemnation: but hath passed from death to life."
A19277,435,83,0,6,"Héere is plaine pardon & free immunitie, from iudge & gaoler, or corpus capias, to bring to the barre, for them that die in the true faith of the Lord: for they are blessed & holy, & shal not sée death, but shal be presently taken vp to life, to be the priestes of God, & Christ, to raign with him for euermore."
A19277,436,84,0,0,"But now to ende this my tedious labor, (O my deare brethre) both tyring you, & much toyling my self gods spirite doth heere tell vs, howe the faithful (whose sinnes, (NOTE_84:0_0) though they haue many, are not laid to their charge) are so farre, from being plunged in a popishe purgatorie, that farre contrary they are exalted into the height of heauen, & called to the companie of those sanctified soules, which daily follow ye lambe, & offer vp to God the holy sacrifice of praise & thankesgiuing, for their redemption in the bloude of the Lambe saying: (NOTE_84:0_1) Amen."
A19277,437,84,0,1,"Praise & glorie, & (PB_85) wisdome & thankes, & honour & power, & might be vnto God, for euer more, Amen."
A19277,438,84,0,2,"These are they, which came out of great tribulations (saith the elder vnto Iohn) & haue washed their robes white, in the bloud of the Lambe."
A19277,439,84,0,3,"Therfore are they in the presence of ye throne of God, & serue him day & night in his temple, & hee that sitteth on the Throne will dwel among them."
A19277,440,84,0,4,"This is not a paineful purgatorie, for it followeth, They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sunne light on them, neither any heate (therefore no hott purgatory fire:) for ye Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne, shall gouerne them, & shall lead them vnto the liuely fountaines of waters, & God shal wipe al teares away from their eyes."
A19277,441,84,0,5,"Behold héere a most blessed felicitie, god grant vs al that be héere to day, (if it be his blessed will) to be partakers hereof."
A19277,442,84,0,6,"And now somthing to say of this reuerend person, whose christian corps doth lye yet before vs, according to the truth of his demerit wt man, & for whose sake, we are héere assembled."
A19277,443,84,0,7,"Somewhat I knew the man my selfe: But I am further (PB_86) assured of him, by such as doe not fawne, but truly feare ye Lord: That he was according to gods prouidence, born vnto Christ, he hath béene trained vp, in Christianity, & mercifully called, from ye pestilent sinke of popery, & from his first féeling of Christ, hath euer costantly in heart, embraced true religion, & very comfortably, made confession therof, in ye whole course of his life, so as his handworking, hath borne good testimonie of his beléeuing heart: & hath so vprightly receiued these great blessings cast vnto him of God, that this offer is made by such as it doth most concerne: If any man bee able iustly to charge him, to haue at any time willingly done wrog to him, or by brybery in his office, to haue enriched himselfe, vppon due proofe hereof, Zacheus tribute shall bée paide vnto him: that is, he shalbe restored foure fold."
A19277,444,84,0,8,"And though this man had his imperfectios with ye sons of god: yet he comfortably felt his beatitude, in his sauiour Christ, euen ye forgiuenes of his sins, in the mercy of God, through him: & therefore as he liued a partaker of the first resurrection: so hee ended this life (PB_87) without feare of the seconde death."
A19277,445,84,0,9,"And as he saw with holy Symeon, the Lord Christ to be onely his saluation: So, we may pronounce of him, with good confidence, that his soule doth rest in peace."
A19277,446,84,0,10,"And no doubt, it is taken vp of Angels, vnto the mount Syon, the citie of the liuing God, the celestiall Ierusalem, (NOTE_84:0_2) & to ye companie of innumerable Angels, & to the congregation of the first born, which are written in heauen, & to god the iudge of all: & to Iesus the mediator of the newe Testament, & to the bloude of sprinkling, that speaketh better things, then that of Habell."
A19277,447,84,0,11,"For it asketh vengeance, more forcibly to the wicked, & promiseth life, & pardon most assuredly to the sonnes of GOD."
A19277,448,84,0,12,"Wherefore to thée our deare father, our sauiour Christ, & the holy ghost, thrée persons distinct, but one immortall god, be all glorie, wisedome, thankes, honor, power & might, for euer more."
A19277,449,84,0,13,Amen.
