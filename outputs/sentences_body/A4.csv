A40728,0,1,0,0," (PB_1) THE seasonablenesse of this Text, & how it suits our case at this time, I need not spend many words to shew: They are the words of the blessed Virgin to her Son, & imply, & contain in them, The losing of Christ had The seeking of Christ lost & the finding of Christ sought."
A40728,1,1,1,0,"They had enjoyed their Son twelve yeares together, & now it was their hard hap to lose him: Longer have we enjoyed him by farre then they did."
A40728,2,1,1,1,"We have had him in his Word rightly taught, in his Sacraments duly administred, & for a signe & confirmation of his blessing upon these, more then fourscore yeares of peace, to the wonder of our friends, & envy of our adversaries: But what shall I say now* When the Angel said to Gideon, The Lord is with thee thou mighty man Gideon answered, O my (NOTE_1:1_0) (PB_2)Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this evill befaln us Surely, so may we conclude, God hath now withdrawn himselfe, because Peace, his greatest blessing upon earth, hath now forsaken us: Gideon, & the Israelites groaned then under a forain Enemy We for want of foes aborad, as if we were ambitious of feud, weary of ease, & thirsty of our neighbours blood, must quarrell one another: Of all plagues upon a Nation, Warre is the sorest witnesse holy David, who rather chose Pestilence, then the sword (NOTE_1:1_1) to destroy him: And of all Warres, Civill is the most destructive, the miseries whereof are next to the torments of hell, which no tongue is able to expresse* O then is God with us, when such unnaturall discord is fallen between us When God was angry, he sent an Evill spirit (NOTE_1:1_2) between Abimelech & the Shechemites, which consumed them both: Here is an Evill spirit now among us, & a flame breaking out, which if not quickly quenched, will consume us root & branch."
A40728,3,1,1,2,Our selves are going the way to destroy our selves from being a people upon the Earth.
A40728,4,2,0,0,"When Christ beheld Jerusalem, he wept over (NOTE_2:0_0) it, & said, O if thou hadst known in this thy day the things which belong to thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eies."
A40728,5,2,0,1,"He saw their sin, & foresaw their sufferings, & the one as the other caused him to weep: oh our sins are hideous, & our sufferings will not come short of theirs, if we prevent them not, our state will prove Felo de se, (PB_3)as your phrase is, & it will be arraigned at Gods Tribunall, as guilty of self-murder."
A40728,6,2,0,2,"Whom will we spare, that will not spare our selves & who will pity us, that will not pity our selves Wee pray every day in our Letany, That God would deliver us from Battell & murder, yet, good Lord, how inclinable are some men, even to that they pray against Nay, which is more, & I know not whether it be more to be deplored or hated, There are of our Long-robe, whose feet (NOTE_2:0_1) should be beautifull for the glad tidings of peace they should bring with them, that are preaching in the place of the God of peace for Warre."
A40728,7,2,0,3,"When the Disciples would have had our Saviour (NOTE_2:0_2) to have fired a Town for their uncourteous refusall of him lodging, he forbad them, & told them, They knew not what spirit they were of Good Lord, what spirits are these men of, that adde fewell to this fire which flames too hot already (NOTE_2:0_3) The Apostles were commanded, that so soon as they entred a house, the first word they should say should be, Peace be to this house: Whose Disciples are these, that have nothing in their mouthes, but Arme, kill, & destroy Scatter thou the people, saith holy David, that delight (NOTE_2:0_4) in Warre."
A40728,8,2,0,4,"Cursed be their rage, for it is fierce, & their wrath, for it is cruell & into their secrets let my soule never come."
A40728,9,2,0,5,"We in Ireland have already smarted under the misery of such Warre, God of his mercy keep it from you here in England But pro quo Orandum, Laborandum They who sit at the Helme, it is their Office to deale in (PB_4)matters of State, & seek the best way of atonement, our indeavours must be in another kind, to settle peace above, to shew how to work a reconciliation between our incensed God & us, to stand (NOTE_2:0_5) with Moses in the gap, & pray our selves, & by our devotion enkindle others likewise, that we may all joyntly say, If thy presence goe not with us, (NOTE_2:0_6) send us not up hence: We are not I hope of the Gadarens minde, to desire Christ to depart our (NOTE_2:0_7) Coasts, rather with the two Disciples we will say, Domine, mane nobiscum: And if he be gone, (NOTE_2:0_8) as I feare he is, with these two holy Saints here, we will goe in earnest quest of him, seek him, & never give over till we have found him for so the blessed Maid implies in her speech, Thy Father & I haue sought thee sorrowing."
A40728,10,4,0,0," (PB_4) I see that before I was aware, I have divided my Text already, & told you the order how I must proceed in the handling of it:"
A40728,11,4,1,0,"I told you but now, that Moses besought Almighty (NOTE_4:1_0) God not to leave his people, but go with them still."
A40728,12,4,1,1,"Though God be, as himselfe saith, Ego Deus & non mutor, unchangeable, & his delight (NOTE_4:1_1) is to be with the children of men, yet we need not goe farre to see the cause why God that had brought that people with so mighty a hand, & out-stretched an arme from Egypt, would now leave them in the Wildernesse."
A40728,13,4,1,2,"They embraced (NOTE_4:1_2) lying Vanities, & so forsook their own (PB_5)mercy they left him by sin, & he left them by Justice: He had not been true to himselfe, but contradicted his purity, if he had stayed with them that had so trespassed God will not be, but either where no sin is at all, or where there is sorrow for sin for, quem poenitet peccasse, pene est innocens: The people he loved, but their sin he hated, & that drove him away from them."
A40728,14,4,1,3,"But what sin had the blessed Virgin committed What evill was she now guilty of, that the joy of her eyes, & the delight of her heart should now leave her Elizabeth wondred, Vnde hoc quod (NOTE_4:1_3) mater Domini venit ad me May not we much more wonder that the Lord of that Mother should now absent himselfe from her, of whom though we may not so much dote as our Adversaries, to say she was as innocent as her Son himself, yet we may without offence, I hope, say as the holy Text speaks of Zachary & Elizabeth, that (NOTE_4:1_4) she was just, & walked blamelesly, sine crimine, though not sine culpa sine querela, though not sine peccato What cause should this harmlesse soule give Twelve yeares together she had enjoyed his blest society, over whose infant-yeares so indulgent was her care, as by her paines & travell she made Egypt a Sanctuary to him, which had been a house of Correction to the Israelites & after her return, never did she wilfully transgresse in ought to displease him, or faile in ought, which should witnesse her dearest affection to him."
A40728,15,5,0,0,"To the annuall celebration of the Feast she (PB_6)goes, nor would she goe without him, in whom her life did consist, & during the time of her abode there, he was with her."
A40728,16,5,0,1,"But at her return, (the word, for sympathy of griefe, will scarce come out) he staies & leaves her."
A40728,17,5,0,2,"But why did she go to it she had a continuall Feast, a quiet conscience within her selfe: besides, she had the Lord of the Feast, her Son with her."
A40728,18,5,0,3,"For no other cause, but because she knew not how to disobey authority: what her Son said afterwards concerning his Baptisme, Suffer it to be so now, for so it becomes us to fulfill all righteousnesse (NOTE_5:0_0) that the Mother now practised: Her son, ne perderet obedientiam, perdidit vitam & so now his Mother, to shew herselfe obedient, lost him that was dearer to her then her life."
A40728,19,6,0,0," (PB_6) What is written, is written for our instruction, & the Saints practise should be, if not our precept, yet our example, & should teach us that publique obedience to Lawes established, is farre more acceptable, then all private sacrifices (NOTE_6:0_0) whatsoever."
A40728,20,6,1,0," (PB_6) Oh how palpably true is that of Solomon It (NOTE_6:1_0) is better to goe to the house of mourning, then the house of feasting for here she loseth him, whom she had so long kept with her: For us now to lose Christ at feasts, is no new, nor strange thing, for we commonly lose our selves at them, turning our laughter into so much folly, as we even (NOTE_6:1_1) make of our mirth madnesse."
A40728,21,6,2,0,"The Minstrels, which I remember Christ once (NOTE_6:2_0) shut out of doores in the Gospel, we with so (PB_7)much greedy delight entertain, as their gingling quite hinders us from affording Christ either (NOTE_6:2_1) room or audience among us."
A40728,22,6,2,1,"But for this Innocent Virgin, Full of grace, as the Angell called (NOTE_6:2_2) her, that she should lose him, is still our wonder."
A40728,23,6,2,2,"I know sin separates between our God & us but (NOTE_6:2_3) what sin doe we reade of that she offended in carefull she was of her son in preserving him, & giving him the best breeding that she could & the best breeding was, that she brought him to the Temple well might she say then, Fili cur sic fecisti nobis What offence had she ever given him wherein had she ever offended him Is this the requitall of her twelve years care This the guerdon of her unwearied love & labour, that now when his yeares should yeeld her most content, he should leave her Had he been meere man, we might have excused it by the descent of love The Angels of love come down faster & oftner on the Ladder, then goe up but being God as man, our wonder is heightned Hath God (NOTE_6:2_4) forgotten to be gracious, & will he shut up his loving kindnesse in displeasure Will he absent himselfe from those that prize nothing so deare as his society He, who though he be provoked every day, yet is loving to all, yea to his enemies: he that (NOTE_6:2_5) sought out Adam when he ran from him, how (NOTE_6:2_6) comes he thus to his dearest mother We must with silence lay our hands upon our mouthes, & knowing it was the Lord, conclude, That the reason of his doings may be somtimes secret, but never unjust: He whose chaire is in mans (PB_8)heart, & sees there as in publique, saw more then we can discern May be that ardency of affection (NOTE_6:2_7) was somewhat cooled by this twelve yeares constant fruition, she did not so highly prize his company as was fitting What the naturall man spake, the Christian finds true, Beneficia carendo, blessings are sooner spied by want, then by enjoying Now then to set a greater price on his presence, that she should esteeme it according to its value, he is pleased to withdraw: How welcome was the day after that multiplied night to the Aegyptians & how highly was Iacob pleased with the news of his son Iosephs life, whom he supposed dead I will goe down & see (NOTE_6:2_8) him before I die."
A40728,24,8,0,0," (PB_8) Besides, she had a greater task then this to undergoe (NOTE_8:0_0) It was prophecied to her, That a sword (NOTE_8:0_1) should pierce through her soul And that was, when she was to see him hang on the tree, & to lie three daies in the Grave It did but prick her now onely to prepare her to her greater triall She must learn to endure a farre longer absence, & must be weaned quite from his bodily presence."
A40728,25,8,1,0,"And withall she must be taught that her Son (NOTE_8:1_0) had a Father in Heaven, whose businesse he must go about: All the world must be profited, as well as she pleased, & they must be redeemed, as well as she satisfied therefore as our first Adam said, A man should leave Father & Mother for his Wife, (NOTE_8:1_1) so this our second Adam, to expresse his infinite love to his Spouse, the Church, having left before (PB_9)his Father in heaven, now leaves his Mother on earth, to initiate that businesse which he must, & will afterwards accomplish, even by the laying downe of his owne life for their Redemption."
A40728,26,9,0,0,"But did Christ leave her indeed did not she rather leave him Is not he that came to seek that (NOTE_9:0_0) which was lost, now lost himselfe as Ioseph was (NOTE_9:0_1) lost while he went to seek his brethren: Did not they leave him at the Feast, & goe away without him May we not say, (with reverence to her person) here was a kinde of Inouria at best, a lesse care then ought to be They went away both, & both went by thoughts & suppositions: We say, Insipientis est dicere, Non putaram And it was some folly to say, Putaram, if it be true as the Jews say, That the men went a part by themselves, & the women by themselves, so Ioseph thought he was with his Mother, & she supposed he was with his Father."
A40728,27,9,0,1,"Would they yet travell a whole day without a sight of him, to advance their opinion into a knowledge, & so to have been ascertained he was amongst them Thus even the best will grow sometimes remisse Can a Mother forget her childe It seems she can (NOTE_9:0_2) the best of Mothers here forgets the best of sons, & so jealous is God of those he loves, as he will not endure the least Act of unkindnesse or undutifulnesse in them: Servants & strangers may goe away with greater errors, when the Son that is beloved shall finde a lash for the least offence: The not beloved ones, wicked & ungodly men, (PB_10)may run on in sin even till they grow old, & sin like withered leaves shall drop & fall from them before they leave it, & in all that time never meet with a whipping but those that are (NOTE_9:0_3) deare to God, deare to him as the Apple of his eye* his chosen ones, they shall be snibb'd & curb'd, & punished upon the least delinquency which, howsoever it may seeme grievous for the (NOTE_9:0_4) present, yet at last they will say with David, It was good for me that I have been afflicted for these (NOTE_9:0_5) afflictions instruct as well as correct, & as they punish, so they teach them their duties."
A40728,28,10,0,0,Thus have we seen Christ lost.
A40728,29,10,0,1,"The Saints in heaven so happily have him, as they cannot lose him, the Bridegroome cannot now be taken from them the damned in hell have so unhappily lost him, as they can never finde him againe, , a great gulfe there is, which they can (NOTE_10:0_0) never foord to finde such a blisse, onely we that live on earth, can both lose & finde him."
A40728,30,10,0,2,"It was carelesnesse at worst in them, but our wilfull sins drive him from us He is a God of pure eyes, & (NOTE_10:0_1) cannot indure to see any pollution & how doe we wallow in all uncleannesse He is a holy God & will be sanctified of all that come neare him, or (NOTE_10:0_2) that he comes neare unto, & what haste doe we make to run into all prophanenesse He is a God of order, & how doe we unhinge all by (NOTE_10:0_3) confusion He is a God of love, & how full of malice are our hearts He is a God of peace, & (NOTE_10:0_4) we dote upon strife & contention He rests not but upon the meek & humble, & how doe (PB_11)we advance our selves even above all that is called (NOTE_10:0_5) God Let us never flatter our selves, & think these sins & Christ can dwell together God & (NOTE_10:0_6) Dagon could not be in one house in the old Law, nor God & Belial in one heart in the new."
A40728,31,10,0,3,"We (NOTE_10:0_7) see the shoales of these sinnes, which have driven him from us God make us sensible of the want of him, & wanting him, give us grace to seek him as these did And so I come to the second, The seeking of Christ lost: Thy Father & I have, &"
A40728,32,11,0,0,"The night which curtains all things else, like (NOTE_11:0_0) a friendly & faithfull counsellor now discovers this want, which the flattering day would not tell them of Then they were so full of discourse & businesse as they had no leisure so much as to think him absent, the fairnesse of the way, & the Company of their friends, did so pleasant their Journey as they scarce minded him, till the day was spent, & they retired to their Inne, & then when they thought to betake themselves to their repast & rest, they perceived that he, without whom they could not rest, was wanting."
A40728,33,11,0,1,"Oh the happinesse of a silent night retirement all the day we spend in turmoile in the world, some (NOTE_11:0_1) wandring, as some of the Jews, in the fields of Egypt, picking straws of folly, things, which may (NOTE_11:0_2) perhaps please the sense, but I am sure cannot profit the soul, whiles others with the rest of the Jews are busied in making brick, labouring as in (NOTE_11:0_3) the fire for very vanity, & producing onely such (PB_12)things of which we may aske as the Apostle (NOTE_11:0_4) did, What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed Others with Ionathan & his Armour-bearer are climbing the steep & dangerous (NOTE_11:0_5) rocks of preferment, whiles others are scratching & wounding themselves even to the (NOTE_11:0_6) quick, with the shiny cares of this world, & all to get that wealth which they know not who shall enjoy & amidst these things, profit, pleasure, (NOTE_11:0_7) & preferment, there is no leisure to minde Christ but when night comes, as certainly it will come, & wee are plucking off our cloathes, & going to bed, then wee shall finde the want of him whose company before wee little cared for: When any night comes, as there are more nights then one, the night of sorrow, or the night of sicknesse, the Usher of that long-long night of death, & we are left alone, & all those former witchcrafts of the day, like those Reeds of Egypt, (NOTE_11:0_8) not onely faile us in our need, but pierce our hands, & wound our soules, & our jocond & blithe company, like vermine out of a falling house, run away from us & forsake us, then wee shall by wofull experience finde, Quam malum & amarum est dereliquisse Domi, (NOTE_11:0_9) how evill & bitter a thing it is to forsake our God: When affliction nakeds us of all those Figge-leaves, wherewith in the day of prosperity we did dresse & pride ourselves, & denudes us of all sinister & vain thoughts, (PB_13) & redeeming us out of the throng & noise of the world, delivers us to a solid consideration, whether Christ, which should have been not onely our Companion, but our guide through this Wildernesse of Sinne, & Valley of teares, be with us yea or no, & if not, then we shall think it high time to goe along with these good people here to seek & finde him out."
A40728,34,11,0,2,"Had the day been lengthened out to that in the dayes of Hezekiah, ten degrees more, I make a question (NOTE_11:0_10) whether they had yet mist him, or been so happy as to have seen their unhappinesse but now the darknesse brings that to light, which the dazeling of the day, & Sun-shine before would not let them see, & being now made sensible of their misse, they will not give their eyes any (NOTE_11:0_11) sleep, nor suffer the temples of their heads to take any rest, till they have found him Now they redeeme their former carelesnesse by a carefull seeking him what in their mirthfull journey they lost, their sad & diligent enquiry makes abundance of amends for: It was never truer then now, that Extrema gaudii luctus occupat, Sadnesse brings in the Voyder, where mirth layes the Cloth nay the griefe for their losse, farre resurmounts the joy of their Feast & if they severed before, Ioseph in one company, & Mary in another, & so lost him, they unite now, not failing either in the maine of seeking, which tels us their industry, or in the object of their seeking, Him, & Him alone, which shews their sincerity, (PB_14)nor in the manner, internall sympathy, both sorrowing, & externall agreement, both together, one teaching us unity, the other uniformity Thy Father & I, &"
A40728,35,14,0,0," (PB_14) These are the branches which now should be shaken but I shall but gather a berry or two off of each of them, cutting off something, as he in Plutarch, which I should say, not to offend in prolixity, their industry in that they seek, their sincerity in that they seek him, their unity in that they seek him both in sorrow, & their uniformity in that they seek him both together."
A40728,36,14,1,0,"We are not to learne what it is to seek, when (NOTE_14:1_0) we lose any thing wee highly prize our eyes, & hands, & feet are all imployed: See but the (NOTE_14:1_1) poore woman in the Gospel that had but lost her groat, how diligently shee sought, & swept every corner of her house till she found it & look upon the good Shepheard, wandring all over (NOTE_14:1_2) the mountaines to finde his strayed Lambe."
A40728,37,14,1,1,"Indeed if Christ bee once lost, he will not readily be found."
A40728,38,14,1,2,"What trouble did Saints of old put themselves unto, when God hid his face from them Thou hidest thy face, saith David, & I (NOTE_14:1_3) was troubled."
A40728,39,14,1,3,"Troubled indeed in minde & in body, to get a glimpse of that glorious countenance shine againe upon him."
A40728,40,14,1,4,"Hee is not easily lost, but by extreame carelesnesse & neglect, but when wee will lose him, hee is not easily to bee found* you may see it here, They lost him but one day, & it was the the third day (PB_15)before they could finde him againe."
A40728,41,14,1,5,"The first & best happinesse is to keep him, to say as Iacob, Non dimittam te, I will not let thee (NOTE_14:1_4) goe unlesse thou blesse mee but the next to that, is presently to misse him, & upon that misse to seek him with all diligence, & without delay."
A40728,42,14,1,6,"Wee are all, or would be thought to bee, Generatio quaerentium, A Generation of (NOTE_14:1_5) those that seeke God but wee seek not as wee (NOTE_14:1_6) ought, we seek as shee did in the Canticles, I sought him in my Bed, I sought him, but I found him not."
A40728,43,14,1,7,"Carelesse, sleight, perfunctory seeking will not doe it The sluggard lusts, (NOTE_14:1_7) & his soule hath nothing, saith Solomon, because hee doth but lust."
A40728,44,14,1,8,"Bad men though they live the lives of the wicked, yet with Balaam (NOTE_14:1_8) they desire to die the death of the righteous but desires alone will not availe, & yet I feare such is all the paines wee spend about it."
A40728,45,15,0,0,"Jesting Pilate asked, Quid est veritas but he (NOTE_15:0_0) went away not caring to be resolved in a question which he thought of so small concernment: so there are many, Qui noncurant quaerere, qui tamen (NOTE_15:0_1) cupiunt invenire cupiunt consequi, & non sequi."
A40728,46,15,0,1,"If wee seeke him upon the downy Beds of rest & ease, it is impossible we should finde him: Foxes have holes, & birds of the aire (NOTE_15:0_2) have nests, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to repose his head."
A40728,47,15,0,2,"Pilate was not satisfied that onely made it Table-talk: Nor (PB_16)the woman that sought at her ease, did not finde Watchman, what in the night cries the (NOTE_15:0_3) Prophet: The morning comes, & also the evening, O si quaeritis, quaerite If ye will seek, do it indeed, & to some purpose, & doe it both while ye may seek, & he may be found: There is a time for every thing under the Sun, (NOTE_15:0_4) saith Solomon The time which God allowes us for our seeking, is Primum quaerite, seek him (NOTE_15:0_5) frst, while he may be found: for that speech in the Prophet, implies there is a time when (NOTE_15:0_6) he cannot be found at all Esau in the Old Testament, & the five foolish Virgins in the New, shew to their griefe that he may be sought when he will not be found."
A40728,48,15,0,3,"It is true I reade in one place, That Hee is found of them which sought him (NOTE_15:0_7) not & S. Paul may be instanced in, whom Christ found travelling to Damascus, & neverthinking (NOTE_15:0_8) of it But that is not to be made a precedent of no more, then because some men have by chance found wherewith to keep themselves all dayes of their lives, others should not labour upon the like hope of the same fortune: But our safest & most warrantable course is presently upon the first misse of him to seeke him: Seeke & seeke him, cum, not aliud (NOTE_15:0_9) in eo, Him for himselfe, & for no other by-respect: The people in the Gospel sought him, but it was for the Loaves wherewith they (NOTE_15:0_10) were fed, & not for love, as himselfe told them what S. Paul said to his Corinths, Non vostra, (NOTE_15:0_11) (PB_17)sed vos, not yours, but you, that we must say to Almighty God, Thee, & thee alone, O Lord, doe we seek: Let us comply with Davids Echo, Seek yee my face Thy face, Lord, saith he, will (NOTE_15:0_12) I seek: Let Demetrius, & his fellow craftsmen, if they will, magnifie Diana, because they (NOTE_15:0_13) lived by making her silver shrines but let Christians be otherwise minded, & think that godlinesse (NOTE_15:0_14) is gaine sufficient or them, & so with holy Iob, trust in God though he should kill them.

A40728,49,15,0,4,"He loves not God at all, that loves any thing besides him nor doth he seek God at all, who seeks ought but himselfe & indeed, what need they seek any thing else for having him, they are sure of all things, , whereof they have need, though peradventure not , which they may fansie a use of: All are (NOTE_15:0_16) yours, for ye are Christs, & Christ is Gods, saith the Apostle."
A40728,50,17,0,0," (PB_17) No marvell now if losing such an one, they (NOTE_17:0_0) were both sad which is the third thing, & teaches us unity of affection, according to S. Pauls (NOTE_17:0_1) advice, to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
A40728,51,17,1,0,"How did Iacob mourn for the losse of one Son (NOTE_17:1_0) in twelve & how did David lament for his lewd son Absalom but when the Text speaks of a griefe not to be paralleld, it is as of one mourning (NOTE_17:1_1) for an onely son."
A40728,52,17,1,1,"Who of us loseth a friend, a child, or a wife with dry eyes how incomparably deare beyond all these in Christ to a soule (PB_18)Let us not prodigally then lavish away our tears for such toyes as these, (for so I may call them in comparison) but reserve them for better purposes."
A40728,53,17,1,2,"Fruitlesse is all griefe in the world but this (NOTE_17:1_2) I do not speak of that worldly sorrow which causeth death, but even that griefe which we may take, for such losses as I spake of can doe us no good could we shed rivers of teares, it could not revive a dead friend, or recover a lost estate, or an empaired health, onely shew how wee love them, as (NOTE_17:1_3) they said of Christ weeping for Lazarus, but not profit us in the thing lost at all."
A40728,54,17,1,3,"And abundance of teares which may blinde our eyes, if spent for any things here below, makes them more cleare to finde him, who will not be found but in sorrow he is vir dolorum, as Isaiah cals him, & so (NOTE_17:1_4) must be sought In his presence is joy, & at his (NOTE_17:1_5) right hand are pleasures for evermore: Needs then must there be sorrow & discontents at his absence, which wee are not sensible of, because wee value him not but Da Christianum & scit quod (NOTE_17:1_6) dico, he knows that there is no joy to the finding of him, nor no sorrow to that when hee is lost: Blame not these then to be sad, & to goe both together in pursuit of him, which is the last, They went together."

A40728,58,19,0,0,"But it concernes me to speak more of Ecclesiasticall peace then Civill O, for the divisions in the Church, What great thoughts of heart are there (NOTE_19:0_0) S.

A40728,64,20,0,3,"Hence the wise Heathen seeking a Deity, in stead of one God found many, & finding many, found none at all & therefore at Athens there was an Altar (NOTE_20:0_2) erected , To the unknown God."

Paul, who puts a flat difference (NOTE_21:0_5) between private houses & Churches, will yet confound them, grounding upon words of Christ to the woman of Samaria, misunderstood, (NOTE_21:0_6) That the time shall come, when they shall neither worship in Samaria, the Temple built there, nor at Ierusalem, but in Spirit & Truth: What he spake of the worship in Samaria, who worshipped God in the likenesse of a Dove, & so not in Truth, & at Ierusalem, where it was in types & shadows, sacrifices, & externall things, even then when the (PB_22)Substance himself was come, & so not in Spirit that they misapply, that there should be no Temples at all & so they go even there to finde him where Christ said directly he was not, non in penetralibus, non in deserto & so even despise the Church of God, as S. Paul complained, or if they do (NOTE_21:0_7) come to it, how doe they make it a common place, by their prophane & rude demeanour in it Can we think this pleasing to Christ, that twice whipt the prophaners out of the third Court, in the Jews Temple At his first Passeover, (REF0) & at his last Passeover, (REF1) And you must know that it was the third Court into which those buyers & sellers came, & not into the second, where none but native Jews, much lesse the third, where onely the Priests were admitted, & yet that outward Court would not he suffer to be abused."
