Death, that is one of the evils and mischiefs, that our own sins will bring upon us, or rather it comprehends in it all the evils of sin, 2.

Look into the Scriptures, and there you shall see, that you shall be no losers but gainers by parting with your sins, 2 Chron. 25. from the 6 th to the 10 th verse, so many will say what shall we do to live, we live by our sins, we gain by our sins, (19.

"2 Kings 1. 2, 3.",2 Kings 1.2; 2 Kings 1.3,,"but know this, that God is able to do more for you than sin can do, 2 Kings 1. 2, 3. what, is there not a God in Heaven to provide for you, that you must go to sin, and the Devil to get a lively-hood."

2 Sam. 18. 33.,2 Samuel 18.33,,"I will explain this by a comparison, this sin is like Absalom, Absalom you know was Davids beloved Son, and Absalom strives to take away Davids Kingdom and also his Life, well for all this David loves him still, and was too fond over him for all this, and was loath to part with him, and when he was killed, see how he mourns for him in the 2 Sam. 18. 33. so here this sin is your Absalom, the sin you are so fond off, the sin you love so well, and do you not know that this sin will take from you, like Absalom, the Kingdom of Heaven, and the life of your Souls, and yet all this will not take off your love from it,"
Rom. 12.,Romans 12,,"This sin will not let a man repent, nor turn to Christ, like Dalilah it binds the strongest Sampson, and keeps many a great professor from turning a true real Christian mark, the Apostles exhortation in the 6 th of the Rom. 12. . O let not sin be King in your Souls;"

Psal. 22.,Psalms 22,,"Beloved, would you have God to stand by you in all your troubles, then cast away your sin, 55. Psal. 22. a man under afflictions that hath this sin about him, is like a man cast into the Sea with a Milstone about his neck, he is sure to sink to the bottom;"
"Lam. 15, 16.",Lamentations 15; Lamentations 16,,"O think upon it, before God lays troubles and afflictions upon you, you cannot but expect them, for your sins have deserved them, therefore I say think upon it before hand which you will chuse, God to be your comforter in your miseries, or keep this sin to add sorrows to all your afflictions, 5. Lam. 15, 16. the joy of our heart is ceased, our dance is turned into mourning, the Crown is fallen from our head, wo unto us that we have sinned:"
Gen. 12.,Genesis 12,,"This is the surest testimony of our Sincerity and Uprightness before God, read the Text, and the 22 th of Gen. 12. So may God say to us, now I know that you love me, seeing for my sake you have parted with your most beloved sin."

"Ex. 1, 2, 5, 6,",Exodus 1; Exodus 2; Exodus 5; Exodus 6,,"3. Here we see the folly of sinners, who for the short pleasure of some beloved sin or other, will venture to undergo the pains of the damned, the torments of Hell and the Wrath of an Almighty God, 21. Ex. 1, 2, 5, 6, verses, the case is the same here;"
Acts 19.,Acts 19,,"here is the tryal, which we love best our own Sins or our own Souls, that which we love best we will not part withal, 3. Acts 19. No sin shall be blotted out at the day of Judgment, but those sins that are cast out here;"
Sam. 19. 4.,Samuel 19.4,,"Do not some of you wonder why David should love Absalom so well, a Murderer, a Traytor, what not, one that in many respects dealt worse with David than ever Saul did, one that was a continual grief to David, yet he loved him dearly for all this, would you know the Reason, see it in the 2 of Sam. 19. 4. why, he was his own Son, that was the Reason."

Daniel 13, 14. God hath publickly in his word proclaimed sin for a Traytor, and hath forbidden us upon pain of his heavy displeasure to harbour any sin in us, now if we make our hearts the rebellious houses of sin, God may justly fire our houses about our ears, and make our habitations like a dunghill."
Prov. 13.; Ps. 5.,Proverbs 13; Psalms 5,,"I can tell you the true Reason, because you have no mind to leave them, the Scripture puts confessing and forsaking of sin together, and confessing is always first, and a means to the latter, 28. Prov. 13. I can tell you further, the Scripture puts confessing and forgiving together, 32. Ps. 5. So that no confessing no forsaking, no forsaking no forgiving."
Psalm. 12.,Psalms 12,,"see what an account David gives us of his sins in the 40 Psalm. 12. if Davids were so many, how many then are ours, oh what desperate madness then to add to that multitude, which we are not able already to number."

2 Kin. 9. 22.,2 Kings 9.22,,"and therefore Solomon tells us that even in laughter the heart of the wicked is sorrowful, 2 Kin. 9. 22. this thine Iniquity is the true Jezabel, and all other sins are but her brats and bastards;"
1 Cor. 7. 39.,1 Corinthians 7.39,,"1. There is nothing to hinder the Union and Marriage between Christ and that Soul; here what Paul tells us concerning the Laws of Wedlock, in the 1 Cor. 7. 39."
Rom. 24.,Romans 24,,"But now kill this sin, and then you are free to accept of Christ, and here is the happiness of every true Saint, Christ and his Soul is united, assoon as sin and his Soul is parted, 7. Rom. 24. it implies thus much;"
Num. 11.,Numbers 11,,"what said Balaam to Balak in the 24. Num. 11. so will Christ say to sinners, depart from me ye cursed, flee away, I thought to have espoused you, and to have promoted you to great honor, but sin hath kept you back from honor and happiness."

Hos. 17.,Hosea 17,,"therefore by the rule of contraries, we may conclude, that if we do abhor, and forsake, and turn Iniquity out of our hearts, then God will hear our Prayers, 2. Hos. 17. what was Baalim, why this was their Iniquity, their great Idol, well what follows v. 21, 22. O Friends, consider well this priviledge, you that come to Church and say your Prayers, for what end is it that you Pray, if you desire not that God should hear you, if not you Pray in vain, if you desire that God should hear you, put away your Iniquities;"
Gen. 5.,Genesis 5,,"we read of Hannah, that when God answer'd her Prayers, she was comforted, her countenance was sad no more, on the other side see the 4. Gen. 5. O we may guess whither God hears our Prayers or no by our faces, and by mens very looks."

Job 6.,Job 6,,"O, but every true convert will loath his sin, and loath himself for it, 42. Job 6. here was a true sign of Jobs Repentance, in that he abhorred himself, and by the way, here we may learn a distinguishing mark and character, between a true convert and an unconverted Person;"

Rom. 19. 6.,Romans 19.6,,"so if you have cast off your old sin, your beloved sin, you will seek as much to destroy, as formerly to maintain it, 6. Rom. 19. 6. That man that keeps himself from his own sin, will be less in censuring others for their sins."
Gal. 1.,Galatians 1,,"And the Reason is this, because he hath had experience enough what it is to grapple with sin, how easie a matter to be overcome by sin, and such a man lives in continual fear of sin, least he be foyled again, least sin should once more get into his heart, 6. Gal. 1. that man that hath conquered sin, knows the strength of sin, better than others, that have never so much as once encountred sin;"
"2 King. 8. 11, 12, 13.",2 Kings 8.11; 2 Kings 8.12; 2 Kings 8.13,,"O he hath learnt by his own experience, to see that sinners have need of pity and prayers, rather than censures and revilings, 2 King. 8. 11, 12, 13. 'Tis a worthy Speech of Dr. Harris saith he, use no more words against mens sins, than thou wilt make Prayers for their Souls in secret."
1 Thess. 5. 22.,1 Thessalonians 5.22,,"every thing that doth but smell of sin, 1 Thess. 5. 22. here is a true note of sincerity, for when we are casting out of sin if we do not cast out every sin, we do as good as nothing, for if we cast out all but one, that one sin in time, will bring in all the rest, and many more again."
"2 Sam. 13. 15, 16, 17.",2 Samuel 13.15; 2 Samuel 13.16; 2 Samuel 13.17,,"8. All they that have parted with this sin, their own sin, their beloved sin, will never return to it more, 2 Sam. 13. 15, 16, 17. so wilt thou deal with this sin, bolt and bar thy heart against it;"
Ex. 16.; Job. 32.,Exodus 16; Job 32,,"the hatred will be irreconcileable, 17. Ex. 16. never make a league with this sin more, herein was Jobs sincerity, 34. Job. 32. such a man would not be in his former condition, living under the power of that sin, no not to gain Ten Thousand Worlds;"
Mark 25.,Mark 25,,"In the Gospel we read when our Saviour cast out the Devil out of many Persons, he charged him never to return again, 9. Mark 25. so when Christ converts a Soul, he turns out sin, as here he turned out the Devil;"
"Luk. 24, 25, 26. &; 2 Pet. 2. 20.",Luke 24; Luke 25; Luke 26.; 2 Peter 2.20,,"so that tho sin still hanker about that man, yet it is never entertained more, 'tis never received into the heart more, there is not that love, familiarity and friendship, that their was before, but now if sin be only like a quartan Ague, to go away for a certain time and then return, that man is no true convert, but his estate is sad, like an Ague, the fit gets strength and returns more violently, there is a dreadful place to this purpose in the 11. of Luk. 24, 25, 26. and in the 2 Pet. 2. 20."
1 Sam. 26. 8.,1 Samuel 26.8,,"I may say to you concerning this sin, as Abishai to David concerning Saul, 1 Sam. 26. 8. O do not you answer as David did Abishai at the 9 th verse, when you have done this, the greatest part of your work is done;"
Jer. 3.,Jeremiah 3,,"For the better understanding of this, you must know what the heart of man is when he comes into the World, and the Prophet will tell us, in the 4. Jer. 3. 'tis fallow ground, and what doth fallow ground bring forth, why the latter part of the verse tells you thorns; what are these thorns?"
"1 Kings 12. 6, 7.",1 Kings 12.6; 1 Kings 12.7,,"this is a great piece of policy, 1 Kings 12. 6, 7. so doth sin come to us at the first with sugured words, with golden promises, with the fairest pretences that can be."
"Prov. 15, 16, 17. v.",Proverbs 15; Proverbs 16; Proverbs 17.,,"Thus Solomon describeth sin to us by an Harlot, 7. Prov. 15, 16, 17. v. what is the event of it, read the 21, 22. v. be sure sin will never loose any thing for want of good words, a thousand fair pretences will it make to get into our hearts."
"Mat. 8, 9.",Matthew 8; Matthew 9,,"3. Sin will bribe the senses to get into the heart, this was the first piece of policy, that the Devil used to make Eve sin, 3. Gen. 6. and as he prevailed over the first Adam with this, so he thought to have overcome the second Adam likewise, by the very same policy, 4. Mat. 8, 9. certainly the Devil made the World to look very beautiful to the eye, that the glorious view of it might have inticed our Saviour, so sin that gets in either by the casements of the eyes, or by the gates of the lips, or the back doors of the ears, or through the sink of the throat, by one sense or another that is bribed or corrupted by sin, and we in the mean time to please our senses entertain sin in our hearts;"
Job. 1.,Job 1,,"the Saints of old, they knew well and found out this Mystery of sin, and therefore they stopt its passage, 31. Job. 1. So David was as careful of his mouth, as Job of his eyes, therefore he prays thus, 141. Ps. 3. and the Reason of it, he gives in the 4. v. O saith David, sin often creeps in at the mouth, and so gets into the heart;"
Pro. 31.,Proverbs 31,,"Solomon hath a strange exhortation, in the 23. Pro. 31. why is it such a matter to look on it, yes, read v. 32. and he sheweth how soon sin gets through the eyes into the heart in the 33. verse."

"2 Kings 5. 17, 18.",2 Kings 5.17; 2 Kings 5.18,,"and thus poor silly men are deceived by sin, and take this for a reformation, 2 Kings 5. 17, 18. so saith the sinner, if God would but pardon me this one sin, I will never be guilty of other sins;"
"2 Cor. 11. 14, 15.",2 Corinthians 11.14; 2 Corinthians 11.15,,"if you be never better reformed than sin can reform you, you may be damned for all such a reformation, 2 Cor. 11. 14, 15. sin is one of the Devils Ministers, his Servants that doth exactly follow his steps for to deceive us."
Gen. 1.,Genesis 1,,"This was the first piece of the Devils policy, 3. Gen. 1. as much as if the Devil had said, what is this your God that you make so much of, and will he not let you eat an Apple?"
"Mat. 24, 25.; Mal. 14, 15.",Matthew 24; Matthew 25; Malachi 14; Malachi 15,,"so sin fills the heart with hard thoughts of God, 25. Mat. 24, 25. And this is the great argument that sin puts into the mouths of wicked Persons, do but hear what they say, 3. Mal. 14, 15. O say they, what a madness is it to be the Servant of God, a sinner fares better and lives merrier, and is far more happy than a Saint, sin perswades the Soul that God is hardest to his best Servants."

Heb. 13.,Hebrews 13,,"O how many are there in the World, that prefer sin before God upon this account, because the Promises of sin are far greater, as to the things of this World, and such things as will best please carnal hearts than the promises of God, and the reason is this, because sin promiseth more than ever it can perform, but God promiseth no more than he will perform, and therefore upon this very account have we that caveat of the Apostle in 3. Heb. 13. Now sin is never more deceitful than in its promises;"
"Judg. 19, 20.",Judges 19; Judges 20,,"As the Danites inticed away Micha 's Priests from him with this policy, 18. Judg. 19, 20. So saith sin, what wilt thou be alone by thy self, come with us we are many."

2 Cor. 10. 4.,2 Corinthians 10.4,,"therefore we read in Scripture of the strong holds of sin, 2 Cor. 10. 4. the word signifieth Forts, Towers, or Castles, places that are kept strong and fortified against all enemies and opposition whatever."

Sin doth not love, that there should be any correspondence kept between Christ and the Soul, it intercepts all letters and messages from Christ to the Soul, and from the Soul to Christ;"
Prov. 1. 4.,Proverbs 1.4,,"because sin knows if these go up, it must come down; sin bars the doors of the heart against any thing that should bring in Christ; this is desperate policy, 29.

Prov. 20. by the strange Woman, and the bosom of a stranger, he means all the pleasures and delights of sin, now he gives us the Reason why we should not embrace these, v. 22. these are the cords of sin to bind us fast, this is sins policy to keep the possession of our hearts, sin cares not what it spend upon us, that so we may still entertain it;"

O Brethren, sin will lurk and lye hid under an Holy Profession, like Goliah 's Sword behind a Linnen Ephod, 2 Tim. 3. 5. 'tis not a man's Baptism, receiving the Sacrament, being of a gathered Church, which People account so much of now-a-days, will clear the heart of sin, sin may deceive you for all that, I might instance in more particulars, but these are enough to shew the truth of it."
Luke 59.,Luke 59,,"What our Saviour said of the state of the damned in Hell, may be truly said of the state of unregeneracy, which is the state of Damnation, 12. Luke 59. so thou canst not come out of this state of unregeneracy, till thou hast parted with thy very last sin."

Deut. 13.; Prov. 31.,Deuteronomy 13; Proverbs 31,,"The Scripture commands us as strictly to avoid the occasions of sin as sin it self, 25. Deut. 13. why some perhaps would say, what harm is there in this, as long as I do not buy and sell by them, O but saith God, thou shalt not keep a false weight in thy bag, 'tis a great occasion of sin, and 'twill draw thee into sin at last, so 23.
