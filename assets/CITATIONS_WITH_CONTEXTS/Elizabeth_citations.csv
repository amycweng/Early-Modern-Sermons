And this doth teach vs to apply the mercies of God vnto our selues, saying,"
Psal. 115.,Psalms 115,,"Neither are wee taught here to beleeue in such a god as the wicked Israelites did, called Baal, which could not heare them when they cryed vnto him, as it is in the booke of the Kings, whō Elias reproueth, 3. Kings. 18. Chap. Of such Idols and gods the Prophet Dauid speaketh, and derideth them & their worshippers, Psal. 115. Saying, they haue mouthes and speake not, eares and heare not, eyes & see not, noses and smell not, hands and handle not, feete and walke not, neither make they a sound with their throte."
Psal. 23.,Psalms 23,,"Thus we see that both must goe together, Gods iustice, and Gods mercie, as Dauid said, Thy rod & thy staffe, they cōfort me, Psal. 23. Wee call him father, not in respect of our creation, for so he is our Maker and Creator:"
Iob. 1.,Job 1,,"Whē we name him almighty, we do not cōceiue him to haue such a power which he doth not vse, but in saying this, we confesse and acknowledge, yt he hath al things & creatures vnder his power & obedience, euen ye deuils themselues, as we see in ye Gospel, how they submitted thēselues to Christ ye sonne of God, & how he asked leaue, before he could do any thing to Iob, Iob. 1. Again, we must needes graūt, that being omnipotēt, and almighty, he doth all things that are done, he ruleth & gouerneth heauen & earth, the sea and hel, & all things in them, the whole world at his beck doth bend & yeld it self."
Mat. 10.,Matthew 10,,"nothing cōmeth to passe wtout his wil and coūsel, no not the flight of Sparrowes. Mat. 10."
Hebr. 1.,Hebrews 1,,"therefore it is said, yt Christ doth susteine all things by the worde of his might, Hebr. 1. And here our faith hath a double cōfort, by ye prouidence & omnipotēcie of God."
Gen. 1.,Genesis 1,,"This proueth, yt he is almighty, because he hath made heauē & earth of nothing, when it was not, Gen. 1. And this doth notably confute the wicked & false opinions of ye Philosophers, as Plato & Aristotle, who greatly to ye derogation & impairing of Gods glory & power, thought & held that the world was eternal frō ye beginnings, and neuer made, neither should haue ende."
Genes. 1.,Genesis 1,,"But these men were deceiued, which thought any ill thing to be created and made ill at the first, for the scripture doth otherwise pronounce of al things, that they were exceeding good. Genes. 1."
Rom. 9.,Romans 9,,"For therefore dyd he sturre vp Pharao King of Egypt, because he woulde shewe his glory vpon him, Rom. 9. Seeing then God hath made heauen, he hath made also all the ornaments of heauen:"
Hebr. 1.,Hebrews 1,,"As concerning the Angels, it is sufficient for vs to know, that they were all made of the Lorde for his wil and pleasure, to be his ministring Spirites, to execute his commandementes and iudgements against the wicked, and for to serue for those that shalbe heires of saluation, Hebr. 1. It is but curiositie to enquire of the time of the creation, or of the orders and estate in heauen."
Titus 3.,Titus 3,,"Seeing all other vaine questions are condemned of the Apostle Saint Paul, Titus 3. The like is to be vnderstoode in making of the earth, to comprehende all things in the earth, whatsoeuer I doe see, heare, and vnderstande."
Iohn 1.; Hebr. 1.,John 1; Hebrews 1,,"For this wisedome by whome all thinges were made, is the Sonne of GOD Iesus Christ, the wisedome of his Father, Iohn 1. Hebr. 1. And here we learne of this wisedome, which he hath vsed and shewed in the creation, a good lesson for our comfort, that as the Lorde is almightie, and able to deliuer vs his children, and Church from the wicked:"
2. Pet. 2.,2 Peter 2,,"Therfore Peter said, The Lorde knoweth howe to deliuer the godly out of tentation and trouble, and to punish the wicked. 2. Pet. 2. So that when man can finde no way, no deuice or meane how to shift him self out of daunger, yet the Lord by his wisedome and knowledge hath diuers wayes to helpe."
1. Cor. 3.,1 Corinthians 3,,"Thus the Lorde scattereth abroade the deuises of the wicked kings and princes of this worlde, by his wisedome, for theirs is foolishnesse to his, 1. Cor. 3.

Psalm. 119.,Psalms 119,,"Dauid often repeateth this lesson, to terrifie the wicked, Iust art thou, O Lorde, & right are thy iudgements, Psalm. 119. So sayde the Emperor Mauricius, being killed by Phocas."
Exod. 19.,Exodus 19,,"This do the wicked confesse thēselues, when they feele his heauy hand vpon them for their sinnes and offences, as Pharao did when the hayle destroyed the cattell of Egypt, saying vnto Moses & Aaron, I haue nowe sinned, the Lorde is righteous, but I and my people are wicked, Exod. 19. Thus the reprobate, whether they will or no, must confesse the Lorde to be righteous in his workes."
Gen. 18.; Ierem. 9.,Genesis 18; Jeremiah 9,,"The Iudge of the worlde doeth according to iustice, as Abraham sayde of him, when he was about to destroy Sodoma, Gen. 18. I delite, sayth the Lorde, in iustice, mercy, and iudgement, Ierem. 9. Examples of his iustice he hath shewed in ye flood brought in vpon the wicked."
Psal. 101.,Psalms 101,,"so that his iustice and mercie goeth alwaies together, as Dauid saith, I will sing of mercie and iudgement, Psal. 101. representing the person of Christ, which should be in his kingdom, as wel iust as mercifull:"
2. Pet. 2.,2 Peter 2,,"Looke vpon Sodome, how the Lord shewed there his extreme and seuere Iustice vpō those miscreants, to consume them with fire and brimstone from heauen most terribly, Gen. 19. and as Peter sayeth, Made them an example for all ages and posterities to come, of his iustice against sinne and vncleannes, 2.

Psalme 2.; Hebr. 12.,Psalms 2; Hebrews 12,,"Then by this wee learne to stand in feare of Gods iustice, if we sinne at any tyme desperately, least we be caught vp with it, and suddenly consumed, If his wrath be kindled, yea but a litle, blessed are al they that put their trust in him, Psalme 2. For our God in his wrath and iustice is a consuming fire, as Hebr. 12. And it is an horrible thing, to fall into his handes."

Luk. 19.,Luke 19,,"The sonne of mā came to saue that which is lost, not to destroy soules, but to saue, and to giue his life a redemption for many, Luk. 19. By this we learne, that there is no other Sauiour appoynted for mā, either in heauē, or earth, but only Iesus:"
Act. 4.,Acts 4,,"For this is the stone which is become the head stone, and the chiefe in the corner, neither is there any saluation in any other, Act. 4. We haue then to seek our saluation not in Angels, not in saints, not in men or in our selues:"

Ioh. 1.; Isa. 11.; 1. Corin. 1.,John 1; Isaiah 11; 1 Corinthians 1,,"For of his fulnesse haue wee all receiued, Ioh. 1. Therefore is he called of Esay, The angel of great Counsell, and that the spirit of the Lord should rest vpon him, the spirit of wisedome & vnderstanding, the spirit of Counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and of the feare of the Lord, Isa. 11. This is a great comfort to vs, to haue such a teacher and Prophet giuen to vs, as is made to vs of God, wisedome. 1. Corin. 1.

Heb. 1.; Ephe. 1.,Hebrews 1; Ephesians 1,,"for he is not only the head of men, but of all the Angels in heauen, as it is said, Let all the Angels of God worship him, Heb. 1. Ephe. 1. Thus ye see how Christ is appoynted Lorde and heyre of all thinges:"

1.

1. Peter. 3.,1 Peter 3,,"The place of 1. Peter. 3. doeth shewe, that the Spirite of Christ was in the dayes of Noe, and preached by him to the wicked which were then rebellious and disobedient, and are nowe damned soules in hell, which he tearmeth spirites in pryson."
Wisd. 3.; Rom. 6. 23.,Wisdom 3; Romans 6.23,,"This is the meaning of Peter in that place, (as also good interpreters doe prooue.) Neyther did Christ descende into hell to fetch the godly Patriarkes from thence, which dyed in his faith before his comming in the flesh, for they were in heauen already as concerning the soule, for the soules of the righteous are in the hands of God, and no torment shall touch them, Wisd. 3. Here then seeing Christ hath suffered and fulfilled all things for vs, we may saye to God as concerning his iustice, O righteous God, if shame, confusion and ignominie bee due to sinners for their euill desertes, if death bee the stipende and reward of sinne, Rom. 6. 23."

Behold, we goe vp to Ierusalem, and the sonne of mā shalbe deliuered vnto the chiefe priests and scribes, and they shall condemne him to death, & shal deliuer him to the Gētiles, to mocke & to scourge & to crucifie, but ye third day he shal rise again."

Rom. 4. 25.,Romans 4.25,,"so the victory of our faith doeth consist especially in his resurrection, euē as the holy Apostle doth plainly expresse it, Rom. 4. 25. for he saith, that Christ was deliuered from our sinnes, but is risen againe for our iustificatiō:"

Reuelation 21.,Revelation 21,,"yea, it shall make them all to quake for feare, for they shall haue their part in the lake that burneth with fyre and brymstone, which is the seconde death, Reuelation 21. This day and the cogitation thereof, serueth most fitly, to put men in mynde of their dueties and callyngs before the Lorde, for so our Sauiour Christe applied it in his tyme in his Gospell, saying to them that were worldely mynded,"
Mat. 16.; 2. Timothie 4.,Matthew 16; 2 Timothy 4,,"for, saith he, the sonne of man shal come in the glory of his father with his angels, and then shall hee giue to euery man according to his deedes, Mat. 16. so doth Paul charge Timo. especially by this iudgement day, saying, I charge thee before God, & before the Lord Iesus Christ, which shall iudge the quicke and the dead at his appearing, and in his kingdome, Preach the worde, be instant, in season and out of season, improoue, rebuke, exhort with al long suffering and doctrine, 2. Timothie 4. As if hee shoulde say in effect,"
"Ephes. 1,",Ephesians 1,,"Christ before sheweth the cause of heauen for y• elect, not their works, but because they were blessed of his father, and that the kingdome was prepared for thē before they were borne, or did any good workes for it, yea, before the fundations of the worlde were layde, as Paul Ephes. 1, sheweth most notably."
Psalme 104.,Psalms 104,,"And this is that, that Dauid speaketh of in his Psalme 104. If thou hide thy face, they are troubled, meaning, all his creatures."
1. Cor. 6.,1 Corinthians 6,,"And of this effect doth S. Paul speake in the 1. Cor. 6. shewing the Corinthians that they were wicked men, as fornicatours, idolatours, extortioners, couetous, theeues & such like, but (saith he) you are washed, but you are sāctified, but ye are iustified in the name of the Lorde Iesus, and by the spirite of our God."
Rom. 8.,Romans 8,,"As we see the writing to be to no effect, without a mans hand & seale, no more are ye graces of God vnto vs, to any purpose, vnlesse he sēd ye earnest of his spirit into our hearts, which doth cōfirme thē vnto vs, and assertaine our cōsciences, ye we are his childrē, & he our father, Rom. 8. This is a notable effect, & is in such sort tasted of ye godly, & approued of thē, as neither ye wisedōe of yt world, nor ye sense & vnderstāding of man is able to cōprehend, neither cā yet be perceiued by ye eyes of mē:"
1. Cor. 2.; 1. Cor. 12.; Ephes. 4:,1 Corinthians 2; 1 Corinthians 12; Ephesians 4,,"for these things are spiritually iudged & discerned, & therefore no maruel, if godly mē hauing ye spirit of God, and speaking therewith, are mocked and derided of the carnall men in this worlde, which haue him not, neither can iudge any thing of him, 1. Cor. 2. This spirit although it be one & ye same, & not many, or deuide, 1. Cor. 12. Ephes. 4: yet in respect of ye diuers & sundry effects & operatiōs of him in ye church of Christ, hee is called & termed by ye name of seuē spirits, yt is, of many, for his manifold gifts."
1. Cor. 12.,1 Corinthians 12,,"al these thinges (sayethe he) worketh one and the same spirit, distributing to euery man seuerally as he wil, 1. Cor. 12. This doeth also teache vs, that this spirit hath most plentifull store of giftes, to enriche the body of the Church of Christ, and that there is no want or lacke in him."
Luke. 11.,Luke 11,,"For Christ hath promised this holy spirit to them that seeke, aske and knock for it, Luke. 11. Doest thou feele thy selfe to lacke fayth, or hope, or loue, or sanctification of life, or any good and necessary gift to edifte Gods Church withall?"
Ioh. 20.; Act. 2.; Act. 6.,John 20; Acts 2; Acts 6,,"For he breathed vpon them, and said, Receiue yee the holy ghost, Ioh. 20. And afterwarde sent it downe more plentifully vpon them, in the likenes of fire and clouen tongues, Act. 2. Wher with they were not a little cōforted in their miseries & troubles against their aduersaries, which were not able to resist them, speaking with this holy spirite, Act. 6. This spirit is sayd to haue diuers names & appellations in ye scriptures, to comfort vs withal in tētations."
Psal. 19.; Psal. 50.,Psalms 19; Psalms 50,,"For surely ye necessitie of him is great, & the vse of him aboue most precious gold, siluer, & pearls, Psal. 19. Dauid vnderstoode this right wel to be so, for hee prayeth that God woulde not take away his spirite from him, but stablish him with his free spirit, Psal. 50. For where ye spirit of the Lord is, there is libertie and freedome from the seruice of ye deuill, & from ye slauery of sin."
Ro. 11.; Iam. 1.,Romans 11; James 1,,"In ye end hee addeth this, as ye cause & mother of al these sinnes, the not hauing of ye spirit, meaning in deede, yt because God hath not giuen thē his holy spirit, therfore they were such kind of mē, as he there painteth forth in their colours, & such as we dayly se here wt vs. And yet for al this, God is not boūd to any man to giue him his spirit, as Paul proueth Rō. 11. neither do they humble thēselues to aske his grace by earnest & hearty praier, for thē should they haue it, Iam. 1. By the lacke and want of this spirite in other men, wee may easily see what a benefite we haue by him, to keepe"
Esa. 44.,Isaiah 44,,"To water it is likened both in the newe and olde Testament, as in Esa. 44. where the Lord sayth, I wil powre water vpon the thirstie, and floods vpon the dry grounde."
Iohn 7.,John 7,,"And that he meant this of the spirit, Iohn immediately declareth, saying, This spake he of the spirit, which they that beleeued in him, should receiue, Iohn 7. As water therfore doeth cleanse and purifie the filthie and vncleane in bodie being washed with it, & is very necessary for our life here:"
Ezech. 36.; Psal. 45.; Act. 2.,Ezekiel 36; Psalms 45; Acts 2,,"And so by and by sayth, I will put my spirit within you, Ezech. 36. Of this pure water speaketh the Apostle to the Hebr. 10. chap. This spirit is moreouer likened to oyle, for the supplenes & gentlenes that is in it, & in thē that haue it, Psal. 45. To fire also is this spirit compared, as we reade in Matth. 3. & Act. 2. For Christ shal baptize with fire, as Iohn saith:"
Ephe. 5.; Psal. 4.; Act. 2.,Ephesians 5; Psalms 4; Acts 2,,"so no doubt doeth the holy spirite of God consume the wicked, scoure our filth, purge our sinnes, & inlighten our ignorant hearts, as Paul saith, Arise thou that sleepest, & Christ shal giue thee light, Ephe. 5. Lift thou vp the light of thy coūtenāce vpō vs, Psal. 4. Thirdly it is cōpared to a great & mighty winde, Act. 2. For as windes doe purge & make wholsome ye aire from his infectiō & cōtagiousnes:"
1. Pet. 2.; Ioh. 3.,1 Peter 2; John 3,,"so doth ye spirit work in the hearts of his, this purging from their old corruption & cōtagion of sinne by Adā, and regenerateth and renueth vs againe by the immortall seede of the worde, 1. Pet. 2. whereby we are borne anewe, that we may enter into the kingdome of heauen, Ioh. 3. The spirite of God is also likened vnto a winde in this respect:"
Exo. 8.,Exodus 8,,"the spirite of God so confounded their wisdome and sorcerie, Exo. 8. Other mo examples might be brought, but I passe them ouer, and leaue them to the diligent readers of the scriptures, where they shall finde store of them."
2. Cor. 6.,2 Corinthians 6,,"and furthermore our bodies are said to be the Temples and houses of the holy Ghost, which dwelleth within vs, as Paul sayeth, Knowe ye not, that your body is the tēple of the holy Ghost? 1. Corinth. 3. & 6. 2. Cor. 6. Seeing this is so, we must prepare our houses, and sweepe them cleane, to entertaine so honourable a ghest."
Iames 1.,James 1,,"for he that doubteth, is not grounded in the faith, but is like a waue of the sea, tost of the winde, and caryed away, Iames 1. How can I haue hope of saluation, as I am commaunded, and yet be in despaire of it, and doubt with my selfe?"
Matth. 5.,Matthew 5,,"for it is false, that they keepe the Lawe, which is a yoke that can not be borne of any man, except Christ, seeing it is spiritual, & biddeth vs not to sinne, neyther in deede, neither in worde, no not so much as once in thought, Matth. 5. And the other is as false, that we should doubt of our saluation."
Iohn 13.,John 13,,"Againe, the loue of God is constant and perfite, and whom he once loueth, he loueth with an euerlasting loue, euen vnto the ende, as Christ is sayde to loue his, Iohn 13. And to whome God hath giuen this spirite of adoption, as he doeth to the Elect, he neuer taketh it away:"
Philip. 1.; 1. Cor. 1.,Philippians 1; 1 Corinthians 1,,"Yea Paul is persuaded of the Philippians, (and so must we be of our selues) that he that hath begunne a good worke in vs, wil performe it vntill the day of the Lord Iesus Christ, Philip. 1. And he hath the like to the Corinthians, that God wil confirme them vnto the ende, 1. Cor. 1. And they that are elected, shal continue:"
Rom. 11.,Romans 11,,"For the giftes and calling of God are without repentance, Rom. 11. S. Iohn a man beloued of Iesus Christ, and to be beleeued before our aduersaries, doubted not to say and affirme for a trueth, in his seconde Epistle to a vertuous Lady, that the trueth which dwelleth in vs, shalbe with vs for euer."
Rom. 8.,Romans 8,,"For there is no damnation to them that are in Christ, which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit, Rom. 8. Neither must this feare bee without faith and hope:"
Iohn 3.; Act. 17.,John 3; Acts 17,,"and if we beleeue in him, we shall haue euerlasting life, Iohn 3. Act. 17. And yet here we must take heede of another extremitie, which the Messalians certaine heretikes, with the Libertines, Anabaptists, & that wicked sect of ye familie of loue, falleth into:"
Acts. 10.,Acts 10,,"and so these commōly contemne the outwarde worde and preaching of the Gospel, with the administration of the Sacraments, whereas we knowe that the spirite goeth, and is giuen by the ministerie of the worde, and is ioyned with it, as Acts. 10. we reade, that while Peter spake the worde, the holy ghost fell on all them that heard the preaching, not before the worde came:"
Ephes. 1.,Ephesians 1,,"for Christ giueth not his spirit, but by the hearing of his Gospell first preached, as Paul sayde to the Ephesians, After ye heard the worde of trueth, the Gospel of your saluation, wherein also after that ye beleeued, ye were sealed with the holy Spirite of promise, Ephes. 1. Here we see, if any would pretend the spirit without the worde, he may bee refuted:"
Esay 1.,Isaiah 1,,"and still, The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, Esay 1. They pretende not the spirit without the worde, although they speake most plentifully by him, 2. Epist. of Peter 1. Chapter."
1. Cor. 2.; Rom. 8.,1 Corinthians 2; Romans 8,,"Now Dauid knewe very well that all these things were done by the operation of Gods spirite, as Paul sayeth, The spirit hath reuealed these things vnto vs, 1. Cor. 2. for it is hee that helpeth all our infirmities, Rom. 8. This is the marke whereby God doeth seale and print in the forehead, to be seene of all men, those that are his, and without the which no man can truely assure him selfe that he belongeth vnto Christ:"
Luk. 11.,Luke 11,,"And of all other things that God giueth, he maketh mention of this spirit, saying, If ye which are euill, can giue good giftes vnto your children, how much more shall your heauenly Father giue ye holy Ghost to thē that desire him? Luk. 11. Signifying this Spirite to be the excellentest gift that God coulde giue, or we desire of him."
Ier. 17.,Jeremiah 17,,"for hee shall be like the heath in the wildernes, and shall not see when any good commeth, but shall inhabite the parched places in the wildernesse, in a salte lande and not inhabited, Ier. 17. By these woordes then of the holy ghost, we learne, not to beleeue in ye Church, but that there is an holy Church of Christe in this worlde euery where dispersed and scattered abroad through the face of ye whole earth."
Hebr. 3.,Hebrews 3,,"Seeing the Church is likened to an house, 1. Timothie 3. and euery house is builded and gouerned of some man, Hebr. 3. it is necessarie that this house also, which is the Church of the liuing God, haue some builder & head of it to looke vnto it, which is both able to do it, & most ready to helpe it."
Mat. 16. 18. &,Matthew 16.18,,"The builder of this Chruch is Iesus Christ, Mat. 16. 18. & he is the only head of it, as S. Paul doth proue most manifestly vnto vs, both in the 1. & 4. chap. of ye epistle of the Ephesians, and the 1. chapter to the Colos. saying, God hath made all thinges subiect vnder his feet, and hath giuen him ouer al thinges to be ye head to the Church, which is his body, euen the fulnesse of him that filleth all in al things."
Ephe. 4.; Colos. 1. 18.,Ephesians 4; Colossians 1.18,,"And againe, Let vs folow the trueth in loue, and in al things growe vp vnto him, which is the head, that is Christ, by whom all the body being coupled and knit together by euery ioynt, for the furniture thereof, according to the effectuall power which is in the measure of euery part, receyueth increase of the body vnto ye edifiyng of it selfe in loue, Ephe. 4. So in the Colos. 1. 18. He is the head of the body of the Church."
2. Corin. 11.; Cantic. 4.; Ezechiel 16.; Ephesians 5.,2 Corinthians 11; Canticles 4; Ezekiel 16; Ephesians 5,,"I haue (sayth Paul) prepared you for one husband, to present you as a pure virgin vnto Christ, 2. Corin. 11. Cantic. 4. Ezechiel 16. Ephesians 5. What noble man will bee content to take a poore wretched beggerwoman out of the streetes, full of ragges and filthinesse, to make her his wife?"
Ezechiel 16.,Ezekiel 16,,"hee can not abide another man to bee admitted vnto his bedde, for that were spirituall fornication and adulterie before him, which hee wyll punishe most seuerely, as hee did in the Israelites which brake couenant with him, and betooke them selues to Idoles, and bowed downe to them in steade of him, as the Prophete declareth, Ezechiel 16. Seeyng then Christ is appoynted the head of his Church, and that one wife (as there is but one bodie, which is the Church) can haue but one husbande to bee her head, and one house, but one Lorde and master to rule it:"
Mat. 28.,Matthew 28,,"for Christ is present with it, as he hath promised, Mat. 28. I am with you alwayes, euen vnto the ende of the worlde."
Ioh. 20.,John 20,,"and in that place hee giueth no more to Peter in the keys, which is the binding and losing of sinners, then he giueth to thē al els where, as in Ioh. 20. when he said, Receiue the holy Ghost:"
Eph. 5. 24.,Ephesians 5.24,,"then is it no reason or right (whatsoeuer ye papists say) yt the authoritie of the church, which is the wife, should be greater and of more force, then the woorde and will of the husbande Christ, seeing that S. Paul saith, Eph. 5. 24. that the church is in subiection to Christ, and from thence draweth an argument of the obedience and subiection of wiues to their husbands, which surely can not be so in euery thing, as Paul there willeth, except the Church bee in subiection, and vnder the authoritie of the will and commandement of the husbande in all things."
1. Timoth. 3,1 Timothy 3,,"The Church is compared and likened to an house, 1. Timoth. 3 or to a family: and shall the houshold and family be aboue the authoritie and will of the master?"
Mark. 3.; Iohn 20.,Mark 3; John 20,,"but he that blasphemeth against the holy Ghost, shall neuer haue forgiuenes, but is culpable of eternall damnation, Mark. 3. So likewise is that place in Matthewe of the keyes expounded in Iohn 20. by remitting or retaining of sinnes by all the Apostles, and not by Peter only."
Psalm. 103.,Psalms 103,,"for they are his members, whome he loueth, and feedeth as a father doth his deare and owne children, Psalm. 103. And if Christ be the head of it, it must needes be holy also, as here we doe beleeue."
1. Ioh. 1.; Gal. 2.,1 John 1; Galatians 2,,"and there is no man without sinne that liueth here in earth, 1. Ioh. 1. yea this church may, and hath erred, as euery member particularly may erre, as Peter did in the vocation of ye Gentiles, Act. 10. and in dissimulation, in eating with the Gentiles, & withdrawing himself from them againe, when Iames came to him, and was iustly therefore reprehended of Saint Paul, Gal. 2. Then if Peter erred, so notable & singular an Apostle, others may erre also, but yet returne with Peter:"
Mat. 13.,Matthew 13,,Mat. 13.
1. Pet. 3.,1 Peter 3,,"Let vs therefore indeuour to be of this body, for without the Church is no saluation, as all perished by the waters, which were not in the arke of Noe, which was a true signe and figure of the church, 1. Pet. 3. And as the hand cut off frō the body, dieth, and lacketh life:"
Eph. 5.,Ephesians 5,,"For Christ doth sāctifie & clense it by ye washing of water through the word, Eph. 5. This made ye prophets in olde time to be careful y• they brought nothing but ye word of God to ye people, saying."
1. Cor. 11.,1 Corinthians 11,,"This made S. Paul to say, y• he had deliuered no other thing to ye church of the Corinthiās, thē that he had receyued of ye Lord, 1. Cor. 11. Neither did Christ, when he sent his Apostles abroad to preach, giue thē liberty to preach what they list:"
Matth. 18.,Matthew 18,,"Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middes of them, Matth. 18. Now these Sacraments are in some thinges vnlike."
1.

Nowe the oftener wee remēber this which is done, especially in the Communion, the better it is for vs, alwaies remembring this, that wee come thither with examination of our selues, as the Apostle willeth, least we come to iudgement and condemnation."
1. Corinth. 14.,1 Corinthians 14,,"If, I saye, they gaue it at any time vnto them, yet they gaue it as a sworde in the sheath, that is, in the Latine tongue, wherein they vnderstoode nothing at all, contrarie to the expresse wordes of Paul, saying, That all thinges shoulde bee done to edification in the Church, and that hee had rather speake fiue wordes in a knowen tongue, then fiue thousande without the vnderstanding of the people, 1. Corinth. 14. I saye these men are guyltie of the death of the Lordes people, which sende them out to fight with their enemies, and yet take awaye their weapons and swordes from them, and so leaue them naked and bare to the spoyle of the enemie."
Psal. 119.,Psalms 119,,"and all because they had not the word, which was the true light vnto their paths, and a lanterne vnto their feete, Psal. 119. Then was it altogether thought good and godly to goe on pilgrimage, to offer to Saintes, to praye to them, to haue images in Churches, to beare candles, to kisse the Pax, to goe on procession, with a thousand such trumperies, which we were delited with, as yong children in toyes and trifles:"
Ephes. 4. ver. 14. & 15.,Ephesians 4.14,,"But let vs follow the trueth in loue, and in all things grow vp into him, which is the head, that is Christ, Ephes. 4. ver. 14. & 15. By these thinges we see, that Rome is not the true Church, because it hath forsaken the worde of God, whereby the Church is gathered together, as men to battell, by the sound of a drumme or trumpet."
Matth. 26.,Matthew 26,,"the cuppe haue they taken away from the common people, and say it was ordayned for the Priestes onely, when as our sauiour Christ sayde, Drinke ye all of this, Matth. 26. They say, not al, but the Priests onely:"

Luke 13.,Luke 13,,"hee answered in effect that it was so, saying, Striue to enter in at the strayte gate, for many, I saye vnto you, will seeke to enter in, and shall not be able, Luke 13. Here Christ sayeth flatly, that many, that is, the multitude, shall not enter in at heauen gates, which yet notwithstanding must bee saued, if the Church, as the aduersaries saye, consist of multitude, for the Church shall bee saued."
Genes. 6.,Genesis 6,,"For all flesh had corrupted his way before God, Genes. 6. Was the greatest multitude in Sodome founde to be of this Church of God?"
Gen. 19.; 2.

There is a notable place cōcerning this matter in ye fourth of Luke, where our Sauiour Christ, entring into the Synagogue of Nazareth to reade and to preach on the Sabboth day, found ye place where it was writtē of him in ye 61. of Esay, saying,"
Luk. 18.,Luke 18,,"But on the contrary side hee refused the company of the Scribes and Pharises, the hie Priestes and Doctors of the lawe, because, although they were sinners, yea, and grieuous sinners too, yet they had an opinion of holines and righteousnesse in them selues, aboue other men, and iustified them selues before our Sauiour Christ, as we see in the parable of the Publicane and Pharise that went vp both of them to praye into the Temple, Luk. 18. These Pharises our sauiour saide, they had no neede of the Physician, because they dyd not acknowledge their infirmitie and weakenesse vnto him."
Iohn 6.; Esay 55.; Iohn 7.; Matth. 11.,John 6; Isaiah 55; John 7; Matthew 11,,"Christ in deede is meate, but for the hungry, Iohn 6. he is water and drinke, but for the thirstie, Esay 55. Iohn 7. he is a refreshing, but for them that are loden and burdened, Matth. 11. Doe wee giue almes at any time to a stout begger, that although he haue neede, yet wil not confesse it, and aske his almes gently, acknowledging his pouertie?"
Luke 3.,Luke 3,,"Let therefore euery hill and mountayne be layde lowe, Luke 3. A notable example of this meeke and humble confession of our sinnes, we haue in the Prophete Dauid, who, although he were a King, yet when he was reprehended and reprooued sharpely of the Prophete Nathan for his adulterie and murder, sayd, without any replying or checking of the Prophete, most mildely,"
Psalme 32.,Psalms 32,,"This thing Dauid reporteth of himself in the Psalme 32. Then I acknowledged my sinne vnto the Lorde, neyther hid I mine iniquitie:"
Psalme 51.,Psalms 51,,Looke in the Psalme 51. where hee describeth the same more at large.
1. Cor. 15.; Rom. 7.; Matth. 5.,1 Corinthians 15; Romans 7; Matthew 5,,"and Paul him selfe doeth in many places confesse with griefe of minde, that he was a persecuter of the Church of Christ, 1. Cor. 15. yea, that he had the relikes of sinne still abiding in him, Rom. 7. Yea this confession & acknowledging of our faults, must sometime be made to our neyghbour or brother, if we haue offended him, and we must, & are commaunded to seeke reconciliation at his handes, as our Sauiour sayeth, Matth. 5."
Psalme 19.,Psalms 19,,"as Dauid sayth, Psalme 19. neyther is this thing warranted by any authoritie or example in scripture. But to our purpose:"
Reuelation 20. 22.; Esay 55.,Revelation 20.22; Isaiah 55,,"but Iohn pronounceth, that if any man thirst, he may come and take of the well of the water of life freely, Reuelation 20. 22. Esay 55."
Psal. 130.,Psalms 130,,"but mercie (saith hee) is with thee, that thou maiest be feared, Psal. 130. Hee declareth vnto vs sufficiently, that wee can not bee iustified before the most pure God, but by forgiuenesse of sinnes:"
Luke 8.; Matthewe 9.,Luke 8; Matthew 9,,"nay rather wee shall be woorse and woorse, runnyng to them, as the woman in the Gospell was with the issue of blood, seeking vnto Phisitions, vntill shee came to Christ, who cured her immediatly, Luke 8. for he is only the good Physition, that came to cure our deadly woundes, Matthewe 9. Will yee then knowe who this is that onely forgiueth sinnes?"
Ioh. 1.,John 1,,"Marke what the holy Ghost saith, Ioh. 1. Behold the lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of the worlde."
Matt. 11.,Matthew 11,,"If this bee so, we may boldely come vnto him at his commaundement, especially when hee calleth, Come vnto mee all yee that doe labour and are laden, and I will refresh you, Matt. 11. The whole scriptures both of the newe and olde testament doe propounde no other redeemer vnto vs, then Iesus Christ."
Iohn 8.,John 8,,"for Abraham reioyced to see his day, and sawe it gladly, Iohn 8. There was but one temple, but one hie priest, but one altar:"
Hebrews. 13.,Hebrews 13,,"Let vs therefore by him offer the sacrifice of praise alwayes to God, that is, the fruite of the lips, which confesse his name, Hebrews. 13. Our sauiour Christ, when he sent forth his apostles to preach, willed not them to preach remission of sinnes, but in his name onely, Luke 24. and this doeth Peter in the Actes declare vnto vs chapter 10. Through his name euery one ye doth beleue, shal receiue remission of sins."
Ephesians 1.; Reuelation. 5.,Ephesians 1; Revelation 5,,"so it is as certaine, that none can bee deliuered from the stinging of the olde serpent which is the deuill, but they that looke vp to the sonne of God on hie in heauen, they haue redemption by his blood, that is, the remission of sinnes, Ephesians 1. There is no other name vnder heauen, wherein we must be saued, no other fundation, whereupon wee must builde vp into heauen, no other stone that coupleth the building together, no other key that openeth heauē gates vnto vs, but Iesus Christ, Reuelation. 5."
Iohn. 8.,John 8,,"Except therefore we beleeue that it is he that taketh away all our sinnes, wee shall die in them, Iohn. 8. Neither is this doctrine onely confirmed vnto vs by the authorities of the worde, but also by the examples of all the godly."
Psalme 119.,Psalms 119,,"Teach me, O Lorde, (saith hee) the way of thy statutes, Psalme 119. Neither shall ye reade, that he went at any time to any other, in that his whole booke of prayers & thankesgiuings, saue onely to the Lorde:"
2. Cor. 12.,2 Corinthians 12,,"Saint Paul praied to the Lorde, to haue the messenger of Satan to depart from him, 2. Cor. 12. Neither can there be any example brought of any, that euer he went to any other then to the Lord onely, to haue his sinnes and offences taken awaye."
Rom. 10.,Romans 10,,"Thirdly, the Iewes can haue or looke for no remission of sinnes, because they haue reiected this Christ, and go about to establish their owne righteousnesse by the workes of the Lawe, whereas Christ is the full ende or perfection of the Lawe, for righteousnesse to euery one that beleeueth, Rom. 10. They haue a zeale, but not according to knowledge, and thinking to bee saued by the Lawe, they all stande accursed, and also accursed iustly by the Law before the Lord,"
Galat. 3.,Galatians 3,,"For cursed (sayeth he) is he that continueth not in all thinges that are written in this booke to doe them, Galat. 3. They are detters then (without Christ) to keepe and perfourme the whole Lawe perfitly and absolutely vnto the Lorde, which no man can doe, no not they, and therefore (without a Sauiour) they stande in a miserable case, euen in the state of euerlasting damnation and perdition."
Matth. 9.,Matthew 9,,"Likewise two blinde men came vnto him to be healed, crying, and saying, O sonne of Dauid, haue mercie vpon vs. This verily was a good confession, and worke of them, Matth. 9. But what sayeth hee vnto them?"
Matt. 9.,Matthew 9,,"Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole, Matt. 9. When he raysed vp the rulers daughter, he required but onely faith of him, which thing the Papistes saye, we can not prooue out of the Scripture."
Iohn 1.; Ioh. 3.,John 1; John 3,,"Speaking of Christ, he sayeth on this wise, He came among his owne, and his owne receyued him not, but as many as receyued him, to them he gaue prerogatiue to be the sonnes of God, euen to them that beleeue in his name, Iohn 1. Againe, So God loued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him, should not perish, but haue euerlasting life, Ioh. 3. He that beleeueth in him, is not condemned, but he that beleeueth not, is condemned already, because he hath not beleeued in the name of the onely begotten Sonne of God."
Ioh. 20.,John 20,,"These things are written, that ye might beleeue that Iesus is Christ the Sonne of God, & in beleeuing ye might haue life through his name, Ioh. 20. It were infinite to recite all the places in Scripture that make for this matter, and I should be tedious, if I would rehearse them all."

Psal. 81.,Psalms 81,,"I am the Lord thy God, which haue brought thee out of the land of Egypt, opē thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, Psal. 81. In that place the Lorde accuseth the incredulitie of the Israelites, that did not open their mouthes in faith, to receiue his benefites in such obedience, as he powreth them out."
Esa. chap. 59.,Isaiah 59,,"Behold (sayeth Esai) the Lords hand is not shortened, that it can not saue, neyther is his eare heauie, that it can not heare, but your iniquities haue made a separation betweene you and your God, and your sinnes haue hid his face from you, that he will not heare, Esa. chap. 59. So Ieremie in his fift Chapter:"
Matth. 13.,Matthew 13,,"Then is it added in the ende of the Chapter, He did not many great workes there, for their vnbeliefes sake, Matth. 13. So likewise our Sauiour Christ sayeth to the father of the childe that was lunatike, considering his want of faith:"
Marke 9.,Mark 9,,"If thou couldest (saith he) beleeue, all thinges were possible to him that beleeueth, Marke 9. And this is the onely cause that barred the Israelites out of the land of Canaan:"
Hebr. 3.,Hebrews 3,,"For we see that they could not enter in, because of vnbeliefe, Hebr. 3. No more shall any enter at all into heauen, which was figured by the holy lande of promes, which beleeue not:"
Reue. 21.,Revelation 21,,"for Iohn sayeth, that all the vnbeleuing shal haue their part in th• •ake that burneth with fire & brimsto•• •hich is the second death, Reue. 21. Nowe when wee saye, that faith alone in Christ doeth applie all his good workes vnto vs, wee doe not speake against good workes, that are done of the godly here in this life, but our meaning is, that our good deedes doe not saue vs, which any man that hath read the Scriptures indifferently, wil graunt."
Matth. 25.,Matthew 25,,"Thirdly, they must be done, because they profite and further our poore neyghbours and brethren, the needy members of Iesus Christ, and in helping them, wee helpe Iesus Christ himselfe, Matth. 25. For so doeth hee account it as done to himselfe."
Matth. 17.,Matthew 17,,"And nothing shall be vnpossible vnto vs, as Christ sayde to his disciples in the like matter, Matth. 17. Nowe faith is sayde to bee a firme and a constant assent of the minde to the wordes of God, wrought by the motion of the holy ghost for the saluation of all the beleeuers."
Actes 10.,Acts 10,,"yea, the holy Ghost it selfe then commeth into our heartes by hearing the worde, as it is reported in the Actes, that while Peter spake, the holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the worde. Actes 10."
Actes 10.,Acts 10,,"This doctrine of faith in Christ Iesus, yt we are iustified by it alone, & by it obtaine remission of sinnes without the works of ye law, is not priuate to some, but cōmon to al that do vnfeynedly beleeue it, whether they be rich or poore, prince or begger, bond or free, Iew or Gētile, in this countrey or that, al are one in Christ Iesus who is brother to all alike, and there is no respect of persons with God, Actes 10. which is a father alike to all that call vpon him in faith and trueth."
Romanes. 11.,Romans 11,,"And all the woorkes of God, if they did not passe our reason and capacitie, then they were there not so wonderfull, neither should theybe vnsearcheable or past finding out, which S. Paul the Apostle affirmeth, Romanes. 11. saying, O the deepenesse of the riches, both of the wisedome and knowledge of God! Many of the better sort of the heathen Philosophers, as Plato, Aristotle and Cicero, although they were fully perswaded of ye immortality of ye soule, yet they neuer did so much as once dreame or thinke of the immortalitie, and resurrection of the fleshe, which we beare about with vs."
Actes 17.,Acts 17,,"but when he sayde and affirmed constantly vnto them, that God had appoynted a day, in ye which he wil iudge the worlde in righteousnesse, by that man whom hee hath appoynted, wherof he hath giuen an assurance to all men, in that he hath raysed him from the dead, thē they mocked, because they heard of ye resurrection from the dead, Actes 17. Well, notwithstanding al this, we that are Christians and trayned vp in the schole of Christ our master, must beleeue this point."
Matthew 22.; Marke 12.; Luke 20.; Luk. 14.,Matthew 22; Mark 12; Luke 20; Luke 14,,"Looke Matthew 22. Marke 12. Luke 20. Our sauiour Christ exhorting rich men to make feastes, and to prouide for the poore, sayde, that they should be recōpensed in the resurrection of the iust, Luk. 14. Where we may note, that the resurrection is sayde to be a recompence and a rewarde for the iust. And surely so it is:"
Iohn 11.,John 11,,"Martha a woman was wel perswaded of this article, for she did beleeue that her brother Lazarus shoulde be raysed vp at the last day, Iohn 11. Againe, if all nations shall bee gathered together before Christ, then all shall rise, that they may bee iudged:"
Act. 26.; Act. 24.,Acts 26; Acts 24,,"or Festus, but he protested, that he had hope towarde God, that the resurrection of the dead, which dyd seeme an incredible thing vnto thē, Act. 26. shoulde bee both of iust and vniust, Act. 24. The hope of this resurrectiō made Saint Paul, as it shoulde doe vs, to do his duetie roundly:"
Matth. 12.,Matthew 12,,"For verely, for this cause doe many men make shipwracke of fayth and conscience in their actions and affayres of this life, because they haue quite forgottē this day of ye resurrection, wherein an account must be giuen, not onely of wicked deedes and blasphemous wordes, but of euery idle worde spoken, as our Sauiour sayeth, Matth. 12. If wee woulde consider this, howe wee must all stande naked before the hie tribunall seate of Christ Iesus, it woulde surely make vs to tremble & to quake euery veine and ioynt in vs, when we thinke vpon it."
1. Thes. 5.,1 Thessalonians 5,,"For it shal come vpon a sudden, 1. Thes. 5. I should be long and ouer tedious, and not seeme to write a Lecture to exhort & teach, but rather a treatise to conuince the aduersarie and wicked, if I shoulde recken vp all the places that here myght be brought for the confirmation of this doctrine."
Reue. 20.,Revelation 20,,"Last of all, I referre you to the 2. Pet. 7. Chap. & Reue. 20. where this resurrection is most liuely, as in a table before your eyes, described."
2. Corin. 5.,2 Corinthians 5,,"We must all (sayeth he) appeare before the iudgement seate of Christ, that euery man may receyue the things which are done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it bee good or euill, 2. Corin. 5. Here he nameth expresly the body, otherwise the rewarde were vnperfite, if in one part onely it were bestowed."
2. Timothie 4.,2 Timothy 4,,"nothing but a sea of troubles & miseries, fightings without, and terrours within, hunger and thirst, colde, nakednesse, bandes and pouertie were the rewardes that the Lorde gaue him here, insomuch, that hee might seeme to be in worse case after his conuersion to Christ, then before, if hee had iudged of his afflictions by a worldly and carnal eye, and not according to faith, as did carnall Demas, and therefore because hee felt miseries in this life, in Christianitie reuolted from Paul, and embraced this present euill worlde, 2. Timothie 4. These things made Paul to say, that vnlesse there were a resurrection, his state had bene most miserable of al others, for what (saith hee) aduantageth it me to suffer these things,"
Luke 16.,Luke 16,,"But they yt with paciēce, & quiet minds can take al things in good worth, whether it be sicknes or pouertie, or shame & ignominie, which ye Lord here sendeth to thē in this life, for a trial of their faith, & can looke vp vnto y• celestial life to come, tarying the Lords leasure, these men are like to poore Lazarus, which in deed in his life time receiued paine, but is now comforted beyond all mās expectation wt an euerlasting comfort, Luke 16. Dauid pronounceth thē blessed that feare ye Lord, & yet if we respect ye presēt time, it doth not so appeare to vs, but rather ye contrary:"

Colos. 3.,Colossians 3,,"but this shall appeare when Christ shall come in glory, Colos. 3. Now if any griefe of mind which is inwarde, come to the soule, then it seemeth to bee in hell, and this dolour surmounteth all the passions and paynes of the body."
Habakkuk 1.,Habakkuk 1,,"Wherefore doest thou looke (sayth hee) vpon the transgressours, and holdest thy tongue, when the wicked deuoureth the man that is more righteous then hee, whereof they reioyce and are glad. Habakkuk 1."
Psal. 73.,Psalms 73,,"Daily (saith he) haue I bene punished and chastened euery morning, Psal. 73. Seeing this standeth so with the wicked, shall wee not say, yt they shalbe punished elsewhere?"
Psal. 37.,Psalms 37,,"Lo, see their cōtinuance, & to what thing it is likened of the holy Ghost, Psal. 37. The third thing in this resurrection, is ye comfort that thereby doth ensue to ye godly, when they thinke & meditate vpō it, which surely is very great."
Iob 19.; 1. Cor. 15.; Luk. 14.,Job 19; 1 Corinthians 15; Luke 14,,"With this resurrection did Iob comfort him selfe in his greatest extremities, saying, I knowe that my redeemer liueth, and that I shall see him in my flesh, Iob 19. This was the comfort of Paul in all his persecutions that hee suffered for ye Gospel of Christ, that the dead should rise againe, ye good to glorie, ye wicked to shame and reproche, 1. Cor. 15. Our sauiour exhorted rich men in this lyfe, to giue almes to the poore, because they should be recōpensed in the resurrection of the iust, Luk. 14. Esay cōforteth ye afflicted church in his time with hope of the resurrection, saying,"
Esaie 26.,Isaiah 26,,"Thy dead shal rise, euē with my body shal they rise, Esaie 26. And what is els the cōfort of the godly at this day in such sorowfull times, and dangerous dayes of sinne, but onely the sure hope of this blessed resurrectiō."
Act. 3.,Acts 3,,"For this day is called the restoring of all things againe to their former perfection, Act. 3. It would greatly reioyce the lame mā or creeple, to heare that all his limmes should bee restored againe perfectly as they were at ye first."
Matth. 13.,Matthew 13,,"For our comfort, this day is likened to the pleasant time of haruest, wherein the godly shall be gathered into the barne of Christ as pure wheat, and the wicked cast out into the fire, as the vnprofitable chaffe good for nothing, Matth. 13. So that they which sowe here in teares, shall there reape in ioy."
Psalm. 49.; Psalm. 16.,Psalms 49; Psalms 16,,"In this day, the righteous shall haue dominion ouer the wicked, Psalm. 49. Dauid when he considered of this day so ioyfull, sayde, that his heart did reioyce, because his body should not for euer be left in the graue, Psalm. 16. This day is called of Paul to Titus 2. The blessed hope, of the effect which it hath to make vs there all blessed without ende in ioy vnspeakeable."
Actes 3.; 1. Thess. 4.,Acts 3; 1 Thessalonians 4,,"Needes therefore must the resurrection be ioyfull, whē as it leadeth vs directly to such a palace of pleasure, as shall neuer ende, & therefore is called of Peter, the time of refreshing, both of bodye and soule, in the presence of the Lorde, Actes 3. The holy Apostle willed ye Thessalonians to cōfort them selues with ye ioyfull remēbrance of this day. 1. Thess. 4. For it shalbe vnto vs as a new birth, or natiuitie in al purenes,"
"Ose 2. chapter, &; Reuelat. 19.",Hosea 2.chapter; Hosea 2.; Revelation 19,,"as the Lord speaketh in Ose 2. chapter, and Reuelat. 19. In this day shall the gates of heauen be set wide open vnto vs, which were shut vp before, & our bodies shall so much excell the bodyes which we now beare about with vs, as the sunne doeth passe and ouercome the moone in brightnesse and light."
Hebr. 11.; Gen. 12.; 2. Cor. 12.,Hebrews 11; Genesis 12; 2 Corinthians 12,,"I am sure this reward so moued good Moses, that hee forsooke the kingdome in Egypt, and suffered paine with the people of God, to come to this life in the ende, Hebr. 11. Yea, this hope of life to come, made Abraham to leaue his coūtrey, and to goe to the land of Canaan as a poore stranger, Gen. 12. This made Paul to go through thicke and thinne in this life, that he might attayne to the resurrection, when he had seene the ioyes and pleasures, that were shewed vnto him in Paradise, when hee was taken vp thither, 2. Cor. 12. Of this ioy, our Sauiour gaue his disciples a tast in the Mount, when hee was transfigured before them:"

1. Pet. 5.,1 Peter 5,,"This shoulde make all Bishops and ministers of the worde, to do their duetie in reprehending sinne stoutly, and in contemning this vayne worlde, in teaching the flock without lucre & gayne, seeing that when the great shepherd Iesus Christ shal appeare, they shal receiue an incorruptible crowne of glory, 1. Pet. 5. Finally, the cōsideration of this life, which is for euer, might make euery estate and degree in their callings, either hie or lowe, to doe most cheerefully their seuerall dueties to all men, that in the ende their parte may bee in the heauenly inheritaunce, which fadeth not away."
Matth. 19.,Matthew 19,,"This is the rewarde that Christ hath promised to them, that followe him here, in the regeneration, that haue for his names sake forsaken houses, brethren, sisters, father, mother, wyfe, children and landes, they shall inherite all things, euen euerlasting life, Matth. 19.

Rom. 8.,Romans 8,,"I count that the afflictions of this present time, are not worthy of the glory that shalbe shewed vnto vs, Rom. 8.

2. Corinth. 4.,2 Corinthians 4,,"For the thinges which are seene, are temporall, but the things which are not seene, are eternall, 2. Corinth. 4. Shall we then for an houres pleasure here below, leese the euerlasting weyght of glorie aboue?"

Rom. 6.; Matth. 25.,Romans 6; Matthew 25,,"This benefite is the free gift of God, for although wee deserue hell and death by our sinne and wickednes, yet we merit not heauen by our good deedes, but as Paul sayeth, Euerlasting life is the free gift of God, Rom. 6. And Christ telleth vs, that this kingdome was prepared for vs long agoe, euen before the worlde was made, or we borne, so that we coulde not step one foote vnto it of our selues, when we were not, Matth. 25. It is false then that the aduersaries of Christ, the Papistes, haue taught, that wee may deserue this life by our good deedes and workes, when as our good deedes are not pure in the sight of the Lorde."

Psal. 50:,Psalms 50,,"These thinges haue I briefly spoken concerning this text, that ye may thereby learne, that God requireth this especially of vs, that we doe firmely and constantly trust in him, and that we freely doe good and be beneficiall to our neighbours, according as God hath of his meere goodnes and mercie bestowed infinite benefits and blessings vpon vs. The Prophet sayth Psal. 50: Heare O my people and I will speake, I my self will testifie vnto thee O Israell, I am the Lord, euen thy Lorde."

Ioh. 14.,John 14,,"For God can not differre or delay, where there is a sincere hart, which trusteth in him alone, all other thinges being left, looking onely vnto the word of God, there God can not hide him selfe, but reuealeth him selfe, & commeth vnto such a hart, & maketh his abode there, as the Lord sayth Ioh. 14. Now what can be more ioyful, thē for a mā to giue credit to the word of God, & to be plucked from it by no affliction or tentation, but to shut his eyes against euery assault of Satan, to lay aside humane sense, vnderstanding, reason, & wisedom, and to say daily in his hart:"

Rom. 3.,Romans 3,,"For God hath so ordained, that all men must depend on that one man Christ, must hope in him, must repose their trust in him, if they desire to be saued, for he alone is set forth of God to be a reconciliation for vs, as Paule sayth Rom. 3. Hitherto one hath cleaued to this sainct, an other to that, one chose to himselfe S. Marie, an other S. Barbarie, and diuers sectes and sortes of religion did flourish."
Luke 11:,Luke 11,,"The holy virgine Marie is not a Christian because of her great worke, for that she did beare Christ so vnspeakeable a treasure in her wombe, as Christ himselfe said to the woman, which cried vnto him from among the people, Luke 11: Blessed is the wombe that bare thee, and the pappes which thou hast sucked:"

Rom. 14:,Romans 14,,"But these workes chosen of their owne proper will, are nothing worth at all, neither can stand, forasmuch as they proceede not of faith, yea they are sinnes, as Sainct Paule saith Rom. 14: VVhatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne."
Phil. 2:,Philippians 2,,"He loued God, inasmuch as he obeyed his will, he tooke vpon him the nature of man, and performed in all obedience those thinges that were enioyned him of the father, as Paul saith Phil. 2: He became obedient to the father vnto the death, euen the death of the crosse. Secondly, he loued his neighbour:"
Ioh. 15:,John 15,,"for all ye workes which he did in the earth, tended vnto this end, that he might therby profit his neighbour, and therefore he so loued his neighbour, that he euen died for him, as he saith himselfe to his disciples Ioh. 15: Greater loue then this hath no man, when any man bestoweth his life for his frends:"
Rom. 5:,Romans 5,,"S. Paul doth more set forth this, saying, for his enemies, when he writeth thus Rom. 5: But God setteth out his loue towards vs, seeing that while we were yet sinners Christ died for vs. Forasmuch then as Christ hath so fulfilled ye law, it could not accuse him, neither was sinne of any force with him."
1. Cor. 15:,1 Corinthians 15,,"Where sinne is not, there death hath nothing to doe, as Sainct Paule sayth 1. Cor. 15: The stinge of death is sinne, with this it killeth, otherwise it should be dull, and haue no strength."
Ioh. 14:,John 14,,"The wretch was ouercome in this conflict, and went away with shame, as Christ sayth, Ioh. 14: The Prince of this world commeth, and hath nought in me."
Col. 2.; Rom. 8.,Colossians 2; Romans 8,,"And so in this conflict the Law, Sinne, Death, Satan and hell were vanquished, ouer all which he triumphed & gloried with great pompe, as Paule sayth Col. 2. All these thinges were not onely done for our commoditie, but also if we beleeue in this Lorde Christ, they are giuen vnto vs. For whatsoeuer he hath, it serueth for vs, yea he him selfe is ours, as Paule sayth Rom. 8. God spared not his owne sonne, but gaue him for vs all to death, how shall he not with him giue vs all thinges also?"

Rom. 4.,Romans 4,,"If thou be righteous, it is profitable to thee among mē, here in eart thou hast the glory & praise thereof, as Paul sayth Rom. 4. But before God this thy righteousnes is of no estimation, thou must set in place thereof an other, namely mine, this God my father doth allow."
Ioh. 16:,John 16,,"Beware that thou presume not to deale before God with thine owne works, but if thou wilt do any thing with him, creepe into me, put on me, and thou shalt obtaine of my Father, whatsoeuer thou desirest and askest, as he him selfe sayth vnto his Disciples Ioh. 16: Verely, verely I say vnto you, whatsoeuer ye shall aske the Father in my name, he will giue it you."
1. Cor. 1.,1 Corinthians 1,,"This S. Paule hath very pithily comprehended euen in one sentence, where 1. Cor. 1. he sayth thus:"
Rom. 4.,Romans 4,,"Christ Iesus is made vnto vs of God, wisedom, and righteousnes, and sanctification, & redemption, that, according as it is written, he that reioyceth, let him reioyce in the Lord. And Rom. 4. he sayth:"
1. Cor 1:,1 Corinthians 1,,"Howbeit all these thinges are enioyed by faith, for he that is without faith, to him they are vnpossible to be comprehended, yea they are counted foolishnes to reason & to the world, as Paul sayth 1. Cor 1: Christ vnto the Iewes is euen a stumbling block, and vnto the Grecians, foolishnes, that is, when Christ is preached, that he is our righteousnes, that saluation commeth vnto vs by him, and that by him we are made the children of euerlasting life, without our owne workes and righteousnes, then those holy men, and iustifiers of them selues are offended, no otherwise then the Iewes."
Haba. 2:,Habakkuk 2,,"For by it the righteousnes of God is reuealed from faith to faith, as it is written Haba. 2:"
Rom. 10:,Romans 10,,"So thou seest now plainly, that this faith which we haue in Christ, commeth by the preaching of the Gospell, as Paule affirmeth Rom. 10: Faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."
Psal. 50:,Psalms 50,,"He is content with this one thing, that we acknowledge him for our God, trust in him, & giue him thankes, as he sayth Psal. 50: Heare, O my people, & I will speake, I my selfe will testifie against thee O Israell:"

Colossians chap. 1.,Colossians 1,,"But prudence signifieth abilitie and knowledge to iudge of worldly thinges, what is right or wrong, which Paule often ioyneth togither, especially in his Epistle to the Ephesians chap. 1. and in his Epistle to the Colossians chap. 1. Of such wisedome Christ speaketh not here, but of worldly wisedome, which puffeth vp men, and excludeth the true wisedome of God."
2. Thess. 2.,2 Thessalonians 2,,"For truly this is certaine, as often as we ordaine a new worship of God contrarie to the word of God, we are byandby blynded, and fall from errour to errour, then which calamitie none greater can come vnto vs. Wherefore Paule 2. Thess. 2. sayth:"
1. Cor. 2.,1 Corinthians 2,,"For it can not be that the naturall man, which consisteth of flesh & blood, and is not instructed by the spirit of God, should iudge and vnderstand those thinges which are of God, as Paule 1. Cor. 2. witnesseth:"

Psalm. 78. 8. 9.,Psalms 78.8; Psalms 78.9,,"Another reason of this doctrine may be this, that if there haue beene any fault in the fathers, it may be amended in the children, and this the worde of God maketh Psalm. 78. 8. 9. it is most dangerous to corrupt the posteritie, for it is like to the poison put into meate before men shall eate thereof;"
"Deut. 24. 8, 9.",Deuteronomy 24.8; Deuteronomy 24.9,,"first that we leaue not any practise or president behinde vs which we haue not learned of the Lord, Deut. 24. 8, 9.

Exod. 10. 4. 5.,Exodus 10.4; Exodus 10.5,,"The reasons of this doctrine are these, First because the Lord by these meanes doth not onely admonish vs all of our transgressions, but especially punisheth vs for our singular rebellion, Exod. 10. 4. 5.

"Amos, 4. 9.",Amos 4.9,,"Therefore first of all the Lord shewing how manie iudgements he had powred vpon the Israelites, Amos, 4. 9. telleth them the vse of all, which was, that they should be cōuerted vnto his maiesty:"

Psal. 137. 2. 8.,Psalms 137.2; Psalms 137.8,,"but also desire to draw other into miserie, Psal. 137. 2. 8. The Edomites that reioyced, and encreased the calamitie of the people of God, are destinated to eternall and most assured aduersities:"
1. Cor. 11. 31.,1 Corinthians 11.31,,"The vses which arise from this doctrine are these, first let vs iudge our selues, that wee be not iudged of the Lord, 1. Cor. 11. 31."
Amo. 6. 3.,Amos 6.3,,"Amo. 6. 3. Children are suffered to be wanton because their yeeres are tender: youth is permitted to bee licentious, because their age is lustie:"
2. Peter 1. 12.,2 Peter 1.12,,"For this cause the Apostle, 2. Peter 1. 12. telleth the faithfull in his time, that he would neuer be negligent to put them in minde of their duetie, although they had knowledge and were confirmed in the truth."
Ioh. 15. 3.,John 15.3,,"The reasons of this doctrine are these, First because it is a true token, that we are the Lords when we are exhorted to farther righteousnes, Ioh. 15. 3. so that on the other side it is a fearefull signe that wee are none of his, when we stop our eares and harden our hearts, against the exhortations of the godly ministers:"
1. Pet. 2. 3.,1 Peter 2.3,,"Another reason is, because it is a notable assurance vnto a mans soule when he beareth exhortation, & increaseth in knowledge, that he hath tasted of the goodnes and grace of God, 1. Pet. 2. 3."
"Reuel. 22, 11.",Revelation 22; Revelation 11,,"for this cause the blessed seruant of God exhorted, Reuel. 22, 11. Let him which is righteous be righteous still;"
Hag. 2. 5. &,Haggai 2.5,,"Secondly, seeing wee all neede encouragement vnto good things, let vs not onely bee exhorted but assured, that the presence of God shall assist vs. When Zerubabel and Iehoshua were stirred by the prophet to finish the temple of God, the Lorde promised his presence to assist them, Hag. 2. 5. and his spirite to remaine with them:"
Nehem. 1. 4.,Nehemiah 1.4,,"But I will specially obserue this doctrine, that all both minister and people when they come to entreate for the remoouing of the Lord hand, must be sure that they be throughly humbled, Nehem. 1. 4. their cause must be well pondered and weighed, their mindes must bee well prepared and perswaded, their liues must be most zealously reformed, and their continuance in their humiliation must be most instantly and inuiolably obserued."
Isa. 58. 3.,Isaiah 58.3,,"Isa. 58. 3. for he then especially looketh to the inwarde disposition of euery soule, to see who they be which tremble at his word and iudgements;"
Esa. 26. 9. &,Isaiah 26.9,,"Another reason is this, because that those iudgements which call for this humiliation, must teach vs righteousnesse, Esa. 26. 9. and so we encrease in righteousnesse, as we exceede in humilitie;"
Iam. 2. 19.,James 2.19,,"The vses which offer themselues by the consideration of this point, are these, seeing we must bee throughly humbled, therefore let vs auoide all manner of idlenesse in this worship of God, Iam. 2. 19. when we are once perswaded of this point, we shall not onely lende an eare to this businesse, but thinke all time too little that we spend not herein."
Ierem. 6. 26.,Jeremiah 6.26,,"Another vse which commeth by this consideration is this, that seeing we must be throughly humbled, or not at all, let vs take for our example the paterne of them that mourne for the dead, as the prophet exhorteth, Ierem. 6. 26."
Num. 3. 12.,Numbers 3.12,,"he thereby giueth vs to vnderstand whose possession are the ministers, namely and onely the Lords, Num. 3. 12."
Act. 6. 2. 4.,Acts 6.2; Acts 6.4,,"The reasons are these, because the whole life of the minister must be onely exercised in spirituall & heauenly matters, Act. 6. 2. 4. The apostles would consent to nothing which was not consonant to their ministerie, or that might any waies hinder the same:"
Exod. 16. 8. &,Exodus 16.8,,"Another reason is, because none may offer them any violence, but the Lorde accounteth it his owne, Exod. 16. 8. and hee saith by the prophet Dauid, Touch not mine annointed, and doe my prophets no harme."
Col. 1. 28.,Colossians 1.28,,"From hence let vs of the ministerie learne our dutie, which is, seeing we are the Lordes owne seruants, let vs labour to present euerie man perfect in Iesus Christ, Col. 1. 28. there is no seruant, but he desireth not onely to do much worke, but that hee may present it faire and beautifull to his masters viewe:"
"Ephes. 4. 11, 14.",Ephesians 4.11; Ephesians 4.14,,"then as the Apostle exhorteth you Ephes. 4. 11, 14. that ye giue heed to them whom the Lorde sendeth you for spirituall guides:"
Verse. 14.,Verse 14,,"and then farewell your hope, your health, and your saluation. The xiij. Sermon. Verse. 14. Sanctifie a fast: call a solemne assemblie:"
"Esay 58. 13.; Iudg. 20. 26, 27.",Isaiah 58.13; Judges 20.26; Judges 20.27,,"Esay 58. 13. Therefore from hence wee obserue that God taketh occasion by threatning of his wrath against vs, to mooue vs to worship him more earnestly, so wee may see Iudg. 20. 26, 27. when the Israelites in a good cause, had beene ouercome of the Beniamites, and lost the liues of many braue men, it mooued them againe to goe to humble themselues before the Lorde, with fasting and bitter weeping, and lamentation."
Mark. 2. 20.,Mark 2.20,,"Wee are for the most part like the disciples which knew not howe to fast, or to afflict themselues till Christ was taken from them, and then they fasted, Mark. 2. 20."
Lament. 2. 14. &,Lamentations 2.14,,"The reasons of this doctrine are these, bicause such kinde of miseries lamented by such kinde of worship, doth turne away our captiuitie, and appease the Lordes wrath, Lament. 2. 14. and therefore wee may take great comfort in the forewarning of our miseries, seeing we may be prepared therby against all danger to auoide all wrath;"
Mich. 4. 5.,Micah 4.5,,"Another reason is bicause that the Lorde will haue that thinge worke the good of his church, which worketh the desperation of infidels, for wicked men in their troubles are at their wits ende, as wee may see Mich. 4. 5. so was it in Cain and Edom, and the Egyptians, and Saule, and Herod, which all perished through affliction."
1. Peter 4. 7.,1 Peter 4.7,,"First, seeing wee are by our affections stirred vp to serue the Lorde, let vs keepe our soules in continuall chastisement, that we may continually be mindfull of the Lordes seruice, 1. Peter 4. 7."
Esay 30. 16. &,Isaiah 30.16,,"or when men growe desperate seeking vnlawfull meanes to be rid of their miseries, as the Iewes did, Esay 30. 16. and therefore the Lorde threatneth them that they shall flie as they determined, and they shall ride on horses as they appointed, but their enimies shoulde ride faster to ouertake and ouerthrowe them."
Esay 58. 3.; Luke 18. 11.,Isaiah 58.3; Luke 18.11,,"And from hence obserue that fasting is nothing woorth without praier, Esay 58. 3. Luke 18. 11. The common people doe imagine that when they cease from eating, and punish their bodies with a daies abstinence, that they doe vnto God high seruice."
1. Cor. 8. 8.,1 Corinthians 8.8,,"First, bicause God doth not except vs for meate, 1. Cor. 8. 8. that is, with the Lorde if wee eate or eate not, wee haue neither the more or lesse, and therefore bare abstinence is not any part of religion."
Luk. 2. 37. &; 2. Cor. 11. 27,Luke 2.37; 2 Corinthians 11.27,,"From hence let vs learne to lead most christian liues which is to serue the Lord with fastings and praiers, after the example of the ancient godly beloued saints of God, as Anna, Luk. 2. 37. and the Apostle Paul, 2. Cor. 11. 27 both men and women haue liued in this kind of abstinence, and religious seruice of God."
Sam. 7. 6.,Samuel 7.6,,"Another vse is, that wee absent not our selues from those solemne and appointed kinde of fasts, 1. Sam. 7. 6. all Israell came to obserue this before the Lord in Mizpeh, and so continued till Samuel sent them home againe."
2. King 8. 10.,2 Kings 8.10,,"so we may read did Elishah, 2. King 8. 10. when Hazael came vnto him and he had annointed him king of Syria, it is said that he wept;"
Iere. 4. 18 19.,Jeremiah 4.18,,"first, because they reape this profit by the forewarning of God, Iere. 4. 18 19. if God of his great goodnes open the destruction of any people or citie to any of his welbeloued sonnes;"
Luke 19. 41.,Luke 19.41,,"Another reason is, because good men although they bee assured of themselues; yet it grieueth them to thinke how the wicked shal be destroyed, Luke 19. 41."
Ier. 6. 8.,Jeremiah 6.8,,"First, seeing that it is the part of a good man to sorrow at the foreknowledge of any calamity, let vs receiue that exhortation of the Lord, Ier. 6. 8. that we be instructed whē the Lord threateneth vs, or else as he there saith;"
Ezech. 12. 27. 28.,Ezekiel 12.27; Ezekiel 12.28,,"this shall not bee yet, it will be a good while before it come to passe, and we neede not care, for wee may bee dead and gone out of the way ere this bee fulfilled, Ezech. 12. 27. 28. but the Lorde rebuketh that follie, and biddeth the prophet tell them that it shall bee shortly performed."
"Deuter. 9. 17, 18.",Deuteronomy 9.17; Deuteronomy 9.18,,"Wherein there is to bee noted, that nothing doth so much feare and terrifie good men, as the anger of God, Deuter. 9. 17, 18. When Moses perceiued that God was angrie, hee fell downe flat on his face and besought God, neither eating nor drinking for fortie daies and nights togither:"
1. Sam. 2. 25.,1 Samuel 2.25,,"First, bicause none can bee an intercessour or a friende to God being angrie. 1. Sam. 2. 25. that is, there is not anie mortall man that can doe any such a pleasure as to staie the Lords wrath from falling on him, or that may bee able to stande in the gap of the Lordes wrath."
Heb. 10. 31.,Hebrews 10.31,,"Another reason is, because it is a most fearefull thing to fall into the handes of the liuing God, Heb. 10. 31. such a fearefull thing as passeth all vnderstanding, and therefore who but mad men will run too farre into this danger."
Mat. 10. 28.,Matthew 10.28,,"first, that wee learne to feare none of them that kill the body, but onely him that is able to cast both bodie and soule into the fire of hell, Mat. 10. 28."
Psal. 2. 11.,Psalms 2.11,,"Another vse is, that we alway keepe our confidence in the Lord, for if his wrath be but a little kindled, then are they blessed that put their trust in him, Psal. 2. 11. Balaam feared God, yet because his faith and confidence was not in the Lord, he was slaine among the other enimies of God:"
Psal. 99. 4.,Psalms 99.4,,"It is saide, Psal. 99. 4. that Moses and Aaron and Samuel put their trust in God, and he deliuered them."
Deut. 16. 11.,Deuteronomy 16.11,,"Whereby we will note this, that the seruice of God must be performed with ioy and delight, Deut. 16. 11."
Rom. 14. 17.,Romans 14.17,,"first, because this ioy in the seruice of God is a token of the presence of God his spirite in the harts of men, Rom. 14. 17. so on the other side when men are lumpish and heauie in this worship and heauenly businesse, it is a token they like not the matter, but are hindered and blinded by the spirit of malice."
1. Iohn. 1. 4.,1 John 1.4,,"Another reason is, because this delight in this worke is the very ende and fruite of the gospell. 1. Iohn. 1. 4."
Psal. 69. 9.,Psalms 69.9,,"first, that whatsoeuer we doe in the Lords house, let vs do it cheerefully, & of an vpright and peaceable minde, that we say of our selues, as Dauid, and Christ of them, Psal. 69. 9."
Psal. 122. 6.,Psalms 122.6,,"Another vse is this, that seeing we must be carefull to worship God with ioy, let vs then pray for the peace of the church, whereby there may be no mourning within our pallaces, Psal. 122. 6."
Hag. 1. 6.,Haggai 1.6,,"Hag. 1. 6. The people of Israel being in some perplexitie, they sowed, and eared, and planted, and laboured to bee releeued, but alas the prophet telleth them, that he wasted their seede, he bloweth on their store, and the labourer putteth his wages into a broken bagge."
Isay 28. 22.,Isaiah 28.22,,"bicause nature it selfe, as a creature of God is subiect to the curse of God, as wee may see in all the storie of Egypt, and also Isay 28. 22. where the Lorde threatneth to bring a consumption vpon the whole earth;"
Rom. 1.; Hos. 5. 15.,Romans 1; Hosea 5.15,,"in seeking to become wise they are made fooles, Rom. 1. Another reason is, bicause there is no other way to life, but conuersion to the Lorde, Hos. 5. 15. Heere is the remedie for our landes, to make the earth furitfull;"
Esay 31. 1.,Isaiah 31.1,,"for seeing these cannot deliuer vs from any little iudgement, then let vs learne to trust in the Lords powre, Esay 31. 1."
Ephes. 2. 3.,Ephesians 2.3,,"but wee must all by nature remaine the children of wrath, Ephes. 2. 3."
Esay. 6. 11.; Luke 21. 4. 5.,Isaiah 6.11; Luke 21.4; Luke 21.5,,"I might also out of this verse note vnto you, that God his wrath shall not onely extende to the liues of men, or those thinges which concerne their necessarie maintenance in this worlde, but also to euerie part of their possessions as this prophet speaketh, euen their barns and houses, as we may see Esay. 6. 11. Luke 21. 4. 5."
Luke 12.,Luke 12,,"And good reason, for as worldly men for their owne pleasures do pul down many times both houses & barnes, as we may see of the worldly man in the Gospell, Luke 12. so may the Lorde for his pleasure doe the like."
Ierem. 21. 16.,Jeremiah 21.16,,"Againe, these thinges do make vs to be proude, euen our buildings and aedifices, as wee may see in Nebuchadnezzar, and also Iehoijakim, Ierem. 21. 16."
Amos 3. 14. 15.,Amos 3.14; Amos 3.15,,"And therefore let vs knowe that the Lord in his iust iudgement will cast downe all these as hee saith, Amos 3. 14. 15. And if he left not one stone vpon another where the temple stoode;"
1. Sam. 15. 3.; Zep. 1. 3.,1 Samuel 15.3; Zephaniah 1.3,,"As for the other, the beastes are punished for mans cause which is the doctrine of this verse, 1. Sam. 15. 3. Zep. 1. 3. euen for our sakes are they pined, and fatted, beaten and brused, because of the sinnes which we haue committed:"
Rom. 8. 20.,Romans 8.20,,"The reasons of this doctrine are these, because they are subiect to vanitie, Rom. 8. 20. vnder hope for the deliuerance:"
Ios. 6. 17. 21.,Joshua 6.17; Joshua 6.21,,"Another reason is, because this doth most notably aggrauate the sinne of man, and might humble them throughly for the same, Ios. 6. 17. 21. for would not I pray you, this strike any man to the heart, to heare all the beasts of the field togither, as the buls bellowing, the oxen lowing, the calues bleating, the lyons roaring, the wolfes howling, the dogs barking, the horses neighing, the Asses braying, the beares crying, and so all other in their kinde and out of kinde, calling in the eares of God for vengeance against man?"
Hose. 4. 2. 3.,Hosea 4.2; Hosea 4.3,,"for God knowing that our deafnes wuld be so great, that the voice of mā should not be heard, hath made euery beast and bird, yea the very thunder to awake vs. The vses which come of this doctrine are these, first, that we fall into a particular cause why this mutinie of creatures and outcries of all beasts should be sent, which the prophet teacheth vs, Hose. 4. 2. 3. to be swearing, and lying, and stealing, and killing, and whooring, and such like:"
Ion. 4. 11.,Jonah 4.11,,"Againe, let vs learne to pitie the poore creatures of God, which for our sakes are thus endangered, liuing vnder tedious labour, and dying vnder the cruell butcher, Ion. 4. 11."
Lam. 4. 9.,Lamentations 4.9,,"and for this do the godly so confesse Lam. 4. 9. that better is the estate of them that die by the sword, then of those that perish by famine: and they giue reasons thereof."
Ezch. 4. 16.,Ezekiel 4.16,,"First that we learne how neere we are to a famine, for the Lord threatneth Ezch. 4. 16. that he will bring a famine, and make them eate their bread by weight, and drinke their water by measure, and do both in griefe:"
Amos. 4. 6.,Amos 4.6,,"Againe, let vs at the verie beginning of our dearth turne vnto the Lord, or else the Lord shall withhold all things from vs, Amos. 4. 6."
"Ios. 7. 7, 8, 9.; Mich. 7. 6, 7.",Joshua 7.7; Joshua 7.8; Joshua 7.9; Micah 7.6; Micah 7.7,,"we must note that we euer adde praiers to our complaints, Ios. 7. 7, 8, 9. Mich. 7. 6, 7. art thou grieued for the sinnes of other men, or for the miseries of the world, and dost breake foorth into wordes for the same?"
Psal. 9. 11. 12.,Psalms 9.11; Psalms 9.12,,"first, because God forgetteth not the complaintes of the poore, Psal. 9. 11. 12. meaning of them that pray vnto him, otherwise hee remembreth no more the poore mans enuie, then the rich mans quarrell;"
Isa. 37.,Isaiah 37,,"therefore let this stirre vs vp, to make our complaint in praier, as we reade Ezechiah did, Isa. 37. when Rabsakeh had blasphemed on the name of God."
Num. 11. 4.,Numbers 11.4,,"Againe, when men doe onely complaine of this or that want without praier, they tempt God, as wee may see Num. 11. 4."
"Hos. 7. 14, 15.",Hosea 7.14; Hosea 7.15,,"Let vs from hence learne to aske of God without murmuring or grudging at our owne estate, or the Lords hand, Hos. 7. 14, 15. for the Lorde will complaine as fast on vs, as we complaine to him."
"Iam. 4. 2, 3.",James 4.2; James 4.3,,"Another vse is this, that if complainers without praying be odious in the Lords sight, although the cause bee indifferent, then much more are those that neuer pray but for vnlawfull and filthie things, that they might bestowe them on their lustes, as the Apostle saith, Iam. 4. 2, 3. They desire health of body, to wallowe in vanitie;"
Gen. 21. 17. &; Psal. 119. 67. &; 1. Sam. 7. 6.,Genesis 21.17; Psalms 119.67; 1 Samuel 7.6,,"Againe, I might also note out of this verse, how afflictions and sorrowes doe teach men to pray most seruently, as we may see in Abimelech, Gen. 21. 17. and in Dauid, Psal. 119. 67. and the reason is, first, because then men beginne to feele their sinnes, 1. Sam. 7. 6. for in truth our consciences are all so guiltie, that if we haue but our finger ake, we presently conceiue it was for some notable sinne or other."
Lam. 1. 22.; 1. Sam. 7. 8.,Lamentations 1.22; 1 Samuel 7.8,,"Againe, as our afflictions are increased, so are our sorrowes, for the hart seemeth to bee pearsed with them, Lam. 1. 22. let vs therefore in our afflictions not onely pray for our selues in our owne persons, but also entreate of other to pray for vs, as we see the Israelites did, 1. Sam. 7. 8. for if we be once perswaded of the benefite of praier, we will neuer cease to stirre vp our selues and others thereunto:"
2. Thes. 5. 2.,2 Thessalonians 5.2,,"we shall be minded as Paul was, that would haue the whole church of Thessalonica to pray for him, 2. Thes. 5. 2. for praier will make men more greedie then golde will."
Lam. 1. 20.,Lamentations 1.20,,"Therefore when we come into the Lords presence, we are to stirre and mooue affections to the vttermost, not with childe-like behauiour, but with childe-like sinceritie and feeling, as we may see in the godly, Lam. 1. 20. where they desire God to behold them, because they bee troubled, their bowels are swelled, and their hart is turned vpside downe, meaning that they were so passionate, that their inward partes were woonderfully mooued."
Isa. 29. 13.,Isaiah 29.13,,"because hee careth not for meane and weake wordes, but for strong and fearefull passions, Isa. 29. 13. for the Lorde being highly to be feared, will especially be then feared ardently, when men speake vnto him by praier."
Psal. 51. 17. &,Psalms 51.17,,"Another reason is, because that an acceptable sacrifice to God is a broken and contrite hart, Psal. 51. 17. and therefore when we offer to the Lorde our praiers, let vs be sure that our hartes bee broken asunder, for as there was no beast sacrificed but his body and shoulders were parted;"
1. Sam. 1. 14. 16.,1 Samuel 1.14; 1 Samuel 1.16,,"First, let vs not iudge euill or rashly of them that are mooued earnestly, and labour effectually in prayer, 1. Sam. 1. 14. 16. When Annah praied before the Lorde, bicause hir lips went and not hir voice, Eli tolde hir shee was drunke:"
Verse. 20.,Verse 20,,Verse. 20.

Gen. 2. 2.,Genesis 2.2,,"The reasons of this doctrine are these; First, bicause God hath created them, Gen. 2. 2."
Psal. 36. 6. 7.,Psalms 36.6; Psalms 36.7,,"Another reason is, bicause men shoulde haue a taste of the excellencie of the Lordes mercy which saueth both man and beast. Psal. 36. 6. 7."
"Mat. 6. 25, 26.",Matthew 6.25; Matthew 6.26,,"The vses which come from hence are these, First that we fall not into any despaire of God his goodnes toward vs, either for our soules or bodies, Mat. 6. 25, 26. where our Sauiour biddeth vs to looke to the lyllies and to the yoong rauens, for whom the Lord taketh care:"
"Prou. 31. 4, 5.",Proverbs 31.4; Proverbs 31.5,,"Surely because as Bathsheba teacheth Salomon, Prou. 31. 4, 5. not to be giuen to excesse, or to be wonne with vanitie because he was a king, that is a worthie man in the world:"
Amos. 9.,Amos 9,,"But when he saith that the little cottages are burned vp, wee may note, that there is not any thing so small or so vile, but the hand of God will finde it out, Amos. 9. Poore men thinke because they be poore, that God neither regardeth their well doing, nor thinketh on their euill:"
Numb. 10.,Numbers 10,,"Concerning this blowing of the trumpet, wee may reade the right vse and first institution thereof, Numb. 10. First it was vsed for assembling the congregation;"
Ierem. 50.,Jeremiah 50,,"the which course the Lorde doth take in other places, when he noteth an inuasion, as in Ierem. 50. In this place wee must first of all handle the blowing of the trumpet, which was the priestes office;"
"Amos. 3. 6.; Ezech. 33. 2, 3, 4.",Amos 3.6; Ezekiel 33.2; Ezekiel 33.3; Ezekiel 33.4,,"for the people were now assembled, and had neede to be terrified to the vttermost to make them humble, as we may see the effect, Amos. 3. 6. for the trumpet might bee hearde farre and neere, as an alarme among vs. Wherefore wee may gather from hence, that it is the ministers dutie to shewe the people of the Lordes wrath, and the danger which they are subiect vnto for the same, Ezech. 33. 2, 3, 4. if they sound not the trumpet, the people cannot be prepared, and then shall they endure a double condemnation:"
Matth. 18. 20. &,Matthew 18.20,,"Secondly, they are the mouth of God to the church, and of the church to God, Matth. 18. 20. and therefore what they sounde, God soundeth; what they binde, God bindeth;"
Ezech. 21. 6. 7.,Ezekiel 21.6; Ezekiel 21.7,,"so the Lorde teacheth Ezech. 21. 6. 7. where the prophet is commanded to mourne bitterly, as a man that mourneth for the paine of the raines."
Act. 18. 6.,Acts 18.6,,"Another vse which commeth by this doctrine is this, that when wee haue so preached, and so liued, then may wee assure our soules of most excellent comfort, as the Apostle doth Act. 18. 6. saie, nowe are wee free from the bloud of all men;"
Psal. 51.,Psalms 51,,"& therefore sometime it signifieth the church of God and all the members thereof, as Psal. 51. By these words I might note, that although the ministers haue a priuate and a publique charge to warne the people:"
Col. 4. 16.; Isa. 66. 6.; Mat. 18. 20. &,Colossians 4.16; Isaiah 66.6; Matthew 18.20,,"yet they must haue a more speciall regard to the publique place, Col. 4. 16. Isa. 66. 6. The reasons are, First, bicause Christ is alway present in the congregation, Mat. 18. 20. and therefore if they haue any loue to their Sauiour, there they must heare and see him."
Gal. 3. 2.,Galatians 3.2,,"Againe in the publique ministerie of the worde is giuen the holy Ghost, Gal. 3. 2. so that if men would haue the pledge of their eternall inheritance, thither they must resort where he is freely offered without money:"

"Ier. 6. 10.; Ezr. 10. 9,",Jeremiah 6.10; Ezra 10.9,,"But in this that he biddeth the inhabitants to tremble at the sound of a trumpet, we are taught, that we must stand before the Lord with feare and trembling, Ier. 6. 10. Ezr. 10. 9, but in our daies men quake in the congregation, as steeples in the sea:"
Isa. 66. 2.,Isaiah 66.2,,"The reasons of this doctrine are these: first, because God dwelleth in them that tremble at his word, Isa. 66. 2."
Heb. 4. 12.,Hebrews 4.12,,"And againe, this feare and trembling is a most manifest signe of the power of the worde, Heb. 4. 12. so that where this trembling is wanting, there can bee no true deuotion, whatsoeuer diligence bee vsed, because the word cannot haue any free passage in our soules:"
Isa. 66. 5.,Isaiah 66.5,,"and thus the Lord assureth his people, Isa. 66. 5. that for their feare he would giue them safetie, and for their trembling hee woulde giue them ioy, and their enimies should be ashamed at it."

Prou. 30. 25. &; Exo. 10. 15.,Proverbs 30.25; Exodus 10.15,,"for he calleth them a people, as Salomon calleth the ants and the conies, Prou. 30. 25. and he saith they shal obscure the light as the morning darknes, bicause their company should bee so many, as we may reade they did in Egypt, Exo. 10. 15."

Psalm. 119. 90. 91.,Psalms 119.90; Psalms 119.91,,"Another reason may be the same that Dauid vseth, Psalm. 119. 90. 91. That the continuance of the earth and all thinges created doe witnesse the perpetuitie of his worde."
Gen. 3. 17.,Genesis 3.17,,"Gen. 3. 17. It is apparant in all the creatures of the worlde, what the sinne of man hath wrought, how it destroied themselues, corrupted their soules, annoied the beastes, defiled the aire, and brought the earth which was all good, and no part there of but very fruitfull, into brambles, and briers, and thistles, and thornes, and weakenesse and barrennesse, to be tilled without ease, kept with all labour, and reaped with little profit."
"Isa. 15. 9,",Isaiah 15.9,,"first, because the Lord in cursing the land destroieth the sinners, Isa. 15. 9, Againe, he will destroy the fruites of the earth, because men doe breake his couenant:"
Gen. 3. 9.,Genesis 3.9,,"Wherefore let vs make that vse that God teacheth Adam, Gen. 3. 9. that seeing the earth is become vnfruitfull, in the sweate of our faces let vs get our liuing, that is, as euery mans sinne is a cause why the earth is cursed, and so become barren;"
Isa. 16. 9.,Isaiah 16.9,,"Againe, seeing the earth is cursed for our sakes, let vs lament the barrennesse thereof, Isa. 16. 9. for in so doing wee sorrowe most iustly for the punishment of our owne sinnes."

The reasons are;"

"Deut. 7. 18, 19.",Deuteronomy 7.18; Deuteronomy 7.19,,"The reasons of this doctrine are these, bicause then they haue no hearts to remember what God hath done for them, Deut. 7. 18, 19. but thinke euermore this is for the sinne, this for such an adulterie, this is for my pride, this for my couetousnes, this for my swearing, this for my contempt of preaching, and all shall be for my damnation."

Psalm. 19. 5.; 2. Sam. 2. 18.,Psalms 19.5; 2 Samuel 2.18,,"The reason is, because it is the greatest commendation of a souldier that can bee, to bee swift and of a ready dispatch, Psalm. 19. 5. 2. Sam. 2. 18. for as a sluggish seruant, a heauie oxe, and a tyring horse are verie discommendable:"

2. Sam. 5. 24.,2 Samuel 5.24,,"The reasons are, first, because we should knowe that the euill onely proceedeth from him, 2. Sam. 5. 24. it doth not any whit distaine the Lords honor to be a reuenger of sinne vpon the bodies and soules of many thousands, but rather it maketh for his glorie;"
Ezech. 32. 9.,Ezekiel 32.9,,"Another reason is, because by this meanes the Lorde doth most earnestly affect good mens harts, and afflict the wicked, Ezech. 32. 9. for the sight of terrible signes cannot choose but mooue the brute beastes of the earth, much more reasonable men, who are more giuen to feare, because they are more giuen to sinne:"

Exod. 19. 18.; Heb. 12. 18.,Exodus 19.18; Hebrews 12.18,,"The reasons hereofare these, because the law of wrath was giuen in fire and earth-quakes, Exod. 19. 18.

Col. 3. 16. &; 2. Tim. 3. 15.,Colossians 3.16; 2 Timothy 3.15,,"Let therefore the word of God dwell among vs plentifully, Col. 3. 16. and let vs exercise the scriptures from our childhoode, 2. Tim. 3. 15. that so wee may haue God in our selues, religion in our hearts, and holines in our liues, that our auncients may teach better, our youth may liue better, our children may learne better, that our houses, our hearts, our liues, our fathers, our sons, our daughters, may bee blessed."
Prou. 14. 35.,Proverbs 14.35,,"From hence wee may note that it is the dutie of christians that liue in these times, since this Gospell was fulfilled, to haue care to make their seruants religious, Prou. 14. 35. or else to make choise of such when they want."
Col. 3. 22.,Colossians 3.22,,"He is a better seruant that liueth well, then hee that laboureth well, for thinke not that hee will euer make conscience of thy businesse, that maketh not conscience of the Lordes businesse, Col. 3. 22. The reasons;"

Rom. 10. 18.,Romans 10.18,,"Secondly, when hee saith hee will set woonders in heauen, wee are taught that God will manifest his wrath before it commeth, Rom. 10. 18. Heauen is in the sight of all, and naturally we are inclined to looke vpward;"

Heb. 7. 25.,Hebrews 7.25,,"we may note that saluation must bee praied for before we can haue it, Heb. 7. 25. Saluation commeth not as honour came on Dauid, which made him a king before hee thought on it;"

"Rom. 11. 15, 16, 26.",Romans 11.15; Romans 11.16; Romans 11.26,,"Secondly, when he saith that there shall bee deliuerance in Mount Sion, wee may note, that God will euermore haue some among the people of the Iewes that shall be saued, Rom. 11. 15, 16, 26. so that, notwithstanding their intolerable hardnesse of hart, and great obstinacie against the Gospell, yet there are some beleeuers among them, and it may be that there shall be a day, when they shall all beleeue in the Messiah:"

The reasons:"
2. Cor. 1. 18. 20.,2 Corinthians 1.18; 2 Corinthians 1.20,,"first, because all the promises of God in him are Yea & Amen, 2. Cor. 1. 18. 20. they are not changeable but constant as it is already declared, because he is mighty that doth his word."

Luc. 13. 23.,Luke 13.23,,"we may note, that but a remant, that is, a very fewe shall bee saued, Luc. 13. 23. The reasons:"
Rom. 5. 14.,Romans 5.14,,"because of the great hatred of God against sinne, Rom. 5. 14. the which hatred shall cause the damnation of many thousands."
Rom. 9. 28.,Romans 9.28,,"Secondly, the Lord will make but a short account of all the earth, Rom. 9. 28."

Iude 5.,Jude 5,,"wee may note, that we must be called by the gospell before we can be saued in the kingdome, Iude 5. But of these points I haue often already spoken in the former treatises, and therefore I may the safer excuse my breuitie;"

Marc. 9. 23.,Mark 9.23,,"Againe, our Sauiour saith, Marc. 9. 23. that all things are possible to him that beleeueth, which is verified in nothing more then in this:"

Isa. 10. 30.,Isaiah 10.30,,"First, because he wil not haue his church to be in desperation of deliuerance, Isa. 10. 30. for our afflictions are called our burdens:"
"2. Thess. 1. 6, 7.",2 Thessalonians 1.6; 2 Thessalonians 1.7,,"for our short enduring calamities are nothing woorthie the glorie which shall bee heaped vpon vs. Another reason is, because that this is a token of the Lords iust iudgement, 2. Thess. 1. 6, 7. The Lord which euerie way doth shew his mercie, will also declare the same in the chastising of his children:"
Isa. 40. 2.,Isaiah 40.2,,"First, letvs neuer despaire for any miseries whatsoeuer, but still hope, Isa. 40. 2. for the Lorde hath alreadie numbred the daies of thy life, and of thy sorrow, and of thy paine, and of thy affliction;"

One angell is stronger then all men, as appeereth by that angel which killed of Saneheribs armie in one night, an hundred fourescore and fiue thousand, Isa. 37. 36. yet for all this power, we must not feare or worship the angels;"
Act. 17. 28. &,Acts 17.28,,"because all the worlde doe liue and mooue and haue their being in him, Act. 17. 28. and therefore he may as easily bring euery one to iudgement, as a man may lay his left hand in his right."

Reuel. 20. 12. &,Revelation 20.12,,"Another reason is, because they are remembred before God, Reuel. 20. 12. and if all the sinnes of the wicked be in the Lords continuall sight and remembrance, then shal they not be forgotten or couered when the number shall be rehearsed."
"1. Sam. 15. 1, 2, 3.; Exod. 17.",1 Samuel 15.1; 1 Samuel 15.2; 1 Samuel 15.3; Exodus 17,,"their childish vanitie, their youthful wantonnes, their sinfull sporting, their filthie resting, their babish trifling, and their merrie pastimes are fresh before the Lord, 1.

Luke 6. 25.,Luke 6.25,,"Another vse is this, that wicked men learne to knowe their owne danger; for woe bee vnto them that laugh, for they shall lament, Luke 6. 25. Blesse not thy selfe when euery one honoureth thee as they did Haman, for presently hee fell to the gallowes:"

2. Tim. 3. 4. &,2 Timothy 3.4,,"Another reason is, because they are louers of pleasures more then louers of God, 2. Tim. 3. 4. and such haue wee in our daies, if loue may bee esteemed by the worke as Maries was by her oile;"
2. Pet. 2. 13.,2 Peter 2.13,,"first, that we consider the miserable estate of these kinde of men, who as the Apostle saith, 2. Pet. 2. 13. shall receiue the wages for their pleasure."

"Psal. 74. 6, 7.",Psalms 74.6; Psalms 74.7,,"and this selfesame thing doe the godly complaine of, Psal. 74. 6, 7.

Pet. 1. 12. excepte wee shalbe found vngratefull vnto God, and that that should bee respected of Angels, and not of men, which pertayneth to men, and not to Angels, Namely to bee the sonnes of God."
Iob. 1.; Gal. 3.,Job 1; Galatians 3,,"By nature there is but one onely sonne of God, Iesus Christ, by creation many, euen all the Myllions of Angels, good and bad, Iob. 1. And by redemption not a fewe, but an infinite number of men, euen the sonnes of Adam, as many as are elected, Gal. 3. And for a certaine péece or spice of the glory and maiesty of God, shyning in the gouernment of the world, the kinges and magistrates of the earth are called gods, as sonnes of God:"
Psalm. 82.,Psalms 82,,Psalm. 82.
Heb. 2. 16. &,Hebrews 2.16,,"for the sonne of God did take our nature, and not theirs, Heb. 2. 16. and made men the sonnes of God, and not Angels:"
2. Pet. 2. 42.,2 Peter 2.42,,"he often appeared in their forme, but neuer tooke their substance, so that they all lie vnder the iudgement as many as fell, and are reserued in chaynes, vnto the darknes of death, 2. Pet. 2. 42."
Gal. 3. 26.,Galatians 3.26,,"The proposition is indefinite, equiualent to an vniuersall, you are the sonnes of God, for you are all the sonnes of God, as it is expressed else where, Gal. 3. 26."
Heb. 6. 18.,Hebrews 6.18,,"The which although the Lord him selfe doe say and that very oft in scriptures, nay albeit for our faith sake hée sometimes doe sweare that by two immutable things wherin it is impossible that God should lie, wée might receaue strong consolation, Heb. 6. 18."
Rom. 8.,Romans 8,,"Yet notwithstanding it is, and hath bene alwaies a Paradox vnto vs, vntill the spirit doe bring his testimony to it, in our hearts crying Abba father, as it is Rom. 8. It is no maruaile therefore if one, a most learned Rabby of the Jewes, a ruler, Nichodemus, so long as he remained naturall in him selfe, did not onely wonder and doubt of this principle of religion, but plainely doate, when hée sayd,"
Iohn. 3. 4.,John 3.4,,Iohn. 3. 4. For thus the braine of man might reason.
Iohn. 1.,John 1,,"I answere that this Generation is not after fleshe and bloude, nor of the will of man, but of God, Iohn. 1. That there came an Adam after Adam, which was before Adam, who came from God, and God was with him, and hée was God, euen our Emanuell, God with vs, who himselfe was made man, and the son of man, that wée might be made the sonnes of God."
Iohn. 12.; Mat. 23.; Rom. 8.,John 12; Matthew 23; Romans 8,,"For as many as receaued him, that is, that belieued on his name, he gaue them power to bee the sonnes of God, Iohn. 12. Wherefore call no man father vppon the earth, saith Christ, for one is your father in heauen, Mat. 23. A father, not for sunne, and raine and no further, but wée are heires and ioynt heires with Christ of his kingdome, Rom. 8. In déede with the wicked God dealeth as Abraham did with ye sonnes of his Contubins, hée geueth them certaine giftes, and sendeth them away."
Gen. 25. 6.,Genesis 25.6,,Gen. 25. 6.
1. pet. 1.,1 Peter 1,,"You are redeemed (saith hée) not with siluer or gold but with the precious bloude of Christ, as of a lambe vndefiled, and without spotte, 1. pet. 1. All the worlde is not worthy to serue for one counter in this reckoning:"
Isay. 49.,Isaiah 49,,"Wherefore, if either the great price a man payeth doe cause great loue of the thinges so bought, or the grieuous paine a woman suffreth in thē Throes and pangues of her Trauaile doe procure a perpetuall minde and memory of her Issue and will not possibly admit forgetfulnes of the same for euer, Isay. 49. Then there is no cause at all of any doubt in Christ whose loue cannot goe backe, him selfe being risen from the dead and ascended into heauen who stucke fast vnto vs in all the agonies and anguish of his death, & though hée turned his head, yet hée chaunged not his heart:"
Rom. 3.,Romans 3,,"Justly therefore might Iohn ye apostle terme the christians here (deerely beloued) at which loue him selfe séemeth to stande astonied in the first verse of this chapter, and therefore by way of admiration hée laboureth to expresse it. (Beholde what loue the father hath shewed on vs, that wée shoulde bée called the sonnes of God.) Wherefore séeing God him selfe hath sayd it, and shewed vs all his secret counsell in it, (for otherwise Christ so borne and buried, so rising and raigning shoulde haue bene but happy for him selfe, and not at all for vs) except God had so ordained him to bee a mediator for vs and set him out to bee a propitiation for our sinnes, Rom. 3. Nay, séeing the Lorde hath sworne it"
Ephe. 5. 8.; 2. Cor. 13. 5.,Ephesians 5.8; 2 Corinthians 13.5,,"You were darknes, but you are now light in the Lorde, Ephe. 5. 8. Prooue your selues therefore whether you bee in the faith, sayth the apostle, 2. Cor. 13. 5."
1. Cor. 3.,1 Corinthians 3,,"but true faith, except it be the naked name, or shrine of faith, the greater it is, the neerer it findeth and beholdeth the Lord, not aboue in the cloudes, but beneath in our hearts, whose Temple wee are, that is, God dwelleth in vs by faith, 1. Cor. 3. The second part."
Eccle. 3.,Ecclesiastes 3,,"There is no oddes betwene a man and a beast, if you respect the body, Eccle. 3. For man being in honour may well be compared to the beaste that perisheth, wherefore you may not iudge by sight, but by faith, not after the externall thinges which are present, but after those thinges which are prepared and to come."
Esay 40.,Isaiah 40,,"All fleshe is grasse, ] Esay 40. And least hée should seeme to doe iniury vnto great men, hee doth geue it with a difference, And all the glorie of it is as the flowre of the field, To whom Solomon the kinge consenteth who termeth the totall summe of all things vanity of vanities."

"Dan. 2, 31.",Daniel 2; Daniel 31,,"yea, though he were ye crowned king, or second to the king his son, or as one of the Princes fellowes, so that for his excellency and beauty he might well bee compared to that glittering Image in the Prophet Dan. 2, 31. whose head was of golde, his breast and armes of siluer, his belly and thyghes of brasse, and legges of Iron:"

Foure thinges I must needes obserue vnto you by the occasion of the words following, the first is, how that all the excellencie of the sonnes of God lieth in these words ( We shalbe like vnto him, ) which in truth excéedeth all declaration, and therefore after certaine similitudes of a crown and kingdome, wherby the Scriptures do speake vnto our capacitie, they conclude the glorie to be such, as no eye hath seene, no eare hath heard, and no heart can conceaue, 1. Cor. 2. 9."
1. Cor. 15.,1 Corinthians 15,,"and if the Saintes shal differ from themselues in glorie, which séemeth by the similitude of the starres vsed in the same cause, 1. Cor. 15. howe much more shall the naturall sonne of God excell in glorie, because he is the head?"
Isay 30. 26.,Isaiah 30.26,,"And if the beautie of the militant Church restored, is said to be such, as if the Moone should shine as the Sunne, and the Sunne should excéede himself seuen times, Isay 30. 26. how much more shall it be in the Church Triumphant in the heauenly Jerusalem, where Christ himselfe is the light and glorie of all the saints?"

Cor. 15. It shalbe with the same bodie, and the same skin, and with the same eyes and no other shall I sée my Redéemer faith the moste patient Iob. 19. 27. that is, the substance of the body remaining the same, the qualitie shalbe cleane altered, which is no monstrous paradox, as that of Poperie:"
1. Cor. 15.,1 Corinthians 15,,"The glorious chaunge is noted, 1. Cor. 15. for mortalitie immortalitie, for corruption incorruptiō and glorie &c."
Psal. 16.,Psalms 16,,"There is nothing that can more comfort vs in or against death, than the resurrection from the dead by the hope whereof our bones doe liue in the graue, and our flesh doth rest because he shal not leaue our soules in hell nor suffer his holy ones to see corruption, Psal. 16. In the olde time this matter was plainly signified by the translation of Henoch and Elias, but nowe it is more fully sealed and assured by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, whose resurrection and ascension is ours in as much as he is ours appointed to be our head, and we his body."

"2. Cor. 12. 9, 10. &; 1. Corinth. 10. 13. &",2 Corinthians 12.9; 2 Corinthians 10.; 1 Corinthians 10.13,,"for (as it is in another place) his grace shall be sufficient for vs, for his power is made perfect through our weakenesse, so that when we are weake, then are we strong 2. Cor. 12. 9, 10. and thus we shall alwaies finde it to be most true, that God is faithfull which will not suffer vs to be tempted aboue that we be able, but will euen giue the issue with the temptation, that we may be able to beare it, 1. Corinth. 10. 13. and if there were no Scripture to prooue it, our owne experience might tell vs the trueth of it:"
"2. Cor. 1. 3, 4, 5.",2 Corinthians 1.3; 2 Corinthians 1.4; 2 Corinthians 1.5,,"For as the sufferings of Christ abound in vs, so our consolation aboundeth through Christ, 2. Cor. 1. 3, 4, 5. And this is so much the more worthy to be considered of vs, because he saith that the spirite shall helpe vs, not in some fewe onely, but in all our infirmities whatsoeuer, and there can be no weakenes in vs so great, or infirmities so many vpon vs, which the spirit shall not strengthen, euen to the bearing of the greatest crosse that may be laid vpon vs, as we heard the Apostle saying before, that God did comfort him in all his tribulations;"
Psal. 31. 22. &,Psalms 31.22,,"I am cast out of thy sight, Psal. 31. 22. & therefore we are not to imagine of such a portion of God, spirite, that might swallowe up all our infirmities (for then we were no men) but it must be sufficient that we are ayded with the strength of it, so that wee finally fall not downe, and lye still vnder the heauy burthen of affliction, but that there is a mixt thing as it were in vs:"
Isa. 38. 14.,Isaiah 38.14,,"This was the estate of good King Hezekiah, Isa. 38. 14. when he was oppressed in the bitternesse of his soule (as he saith) & he chattered like a Crane or a Swallow, and mourned as a Doue."

"Matt. 10. 19, 20.",Matthew 10.19; Matthew 10.20,,"Matt. 10. 19, 20. that when they shoulde be brought before kings they should not take thought what or how to speake for he would giue them in that houre what to say, because it was not they which should speake, but the spirite of the Father vvhich speaketh in them:"
"2. Kings 20. 2, 3. &",2 Kings 20.2; 2 Kings 3.,,"For no doubt those men that we spake of before euen at those times when they could not tell, what and hovv to pray as of them-selues, yet the spirite helping them, they did pray, and there were at least vnspeakeable sighes and grones stirred up in them, For it is said of Hezekiah that hee then turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lorde and wept sore, 2. Kings 20. 2, 3. and Dauid vvhen as in his owne feeling hee did but roare and sigh:"
Psal. 55. 2. &,Psalms 55.2,,"euen then he poured out, &, that very plentifully his whole desire before the Lord, Psal. 38. and when he did but mourne and make a noise, it was counted a prayer before the Lord, Psal. 55. 2. and when as he saith that his grouings were like the Pelicans, & the sparrows, or the shriekings of an owle, yet to shew that in them there was a worke of Gods spirite, that made them acceptable to him, he beginneth the Psalme thus:"
"Exod, 2. 23. 24.",Exodus 2.23; Exodus 2.24,,"So it is saide of the whole Church of God in Egypt, Exod, 2. 23. 24. that vvhen for the extremitie of their bondage they could not pray unto God, yet they cryed and sighed and mourned unto him."
Psalm. 1. 6.,Psalms 1.6,,"for by knowing, he doth not only meane, that he understandeth it, as he doth all other things, but he accepteth and alloweth it, and doeth most willingly graunt such requestes, as though they were made in farre better liking to our selues, and so is the word taken, Psalm. 1. 6. The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous."
"2. Cor. 12. 8, 9.",2 Corinthians 12.8; 2 Corinthians 12.9,,"Thus when Paul prayed thrise that the messenger of Sathan might depart from him, the Lorde in giuing him his grace, that was sufficient for him, & making his power known in the Apostles weakenes, 2. Cor. 12. 8, 9. did both satisfie the meaning of his spirit, & turne his crosse unto his singular good."
"Heb. 11. 9, 10.",Hebrews 11.9; Hebrews 11.10,,"that they might not stay in them, but from them ascend vp into heauen which they were especially to looke for, as the Apostle faith, Heb. 11. 9, 10. that Abraham, Isaak, and Iaakob heyres of the promise, aboad in the land of promise, as in a straunge cuntrey:"

Cor. 11. 31, 32. whereunto agreeth that Psal. 107. 10. &c. that affliction humbleth men vnto true repentance before God, euen as we see it to be true in the Prodigal child, who by his great miserie came to repent him of his riotous life, Luk. 15. 16. and the brethren of Ioseph, though we may presume of them, that they being brought vp in the house of there godly father, did secretly repēt there ill dealing towards Ioseph, yet many yeres after, about 20. or there about, when they were in aduersitie, the memorie of it renued it selfe afresh, and thereby they weare brought more seriously to iudge them selues for it;"
Psal. 119. 67. 71.,Psalms 119.67; Psalms 119.71,,"And Psal. 119. 67. 71. Before I was afflicted, I went astray, but now I keepe thy word:"
"Peter, 1.; Epist. 1. 6, 7.",Peter 1; Epistle 1.6; Epistle 1.7,,"Thus speaketh the Apostle Peter, 1. Epist. 1. 6, 7. Now for a season if neede require, ye are in heauines through manifold tentations, that the triall of your faith beeing much more precious then gold that perisheth (though it be tried with fire) might be found vnto your praise, honour, and glorie, at the appearing of Iesus Christ."
Gen. 22. 1.; Hebr. 11. 17.,Genesis 22.1; Hebrews 11.17,,"Thus was Abraham prooued, Gen. 22. 1. when the Lord commaunded him to offer vp his onely sonne Isaak whome he loued, which he willingly obeyed, and by faith offered him vp, Hebr. 11. 17. so that the Lord saith, now it was knowne by good proofe that he feared the Lord, when for his sake he had not spared his onely sonne."
Luk. 8. 13. &,Luke 8.13,,"and so though they beleeued for a time, yet then shew that the word was not rooted in them, Luk. 8. 13. and thus it is knowne who haue builded there houses vpon the rocke, and who vpon the sands, who haue beene onely hearers of the word, and who doers of the same."
Galat. chap. 5. vers. 6.,Galatians 5.6,,"nowe the true and faithfull beleeuers as he hath before discerned them from others by this fruite of faith, namely sanctification, so he doth here by one part of it, which is loue, as in the Epistle to the Galat. chap. 5. vers. 6. so that vnder one kinde he comprehendeth all godlinesse, but he taketh this thing rather then any other, as most fitte for his purpose;"
Psalme 66. 10.,Psalms 66.10,,"Therefore the seruants of God haue confessed, that the Lorde himselfe hath brought all their troubles upon them, as Psalme 66. 10. Thou, O God, hast prooved, thou hast tried vs as silver is tried, thou hast brought vs into the s•are, and laide a straite chaine upon our loynes, thou hast caused men to ride over our heades."
