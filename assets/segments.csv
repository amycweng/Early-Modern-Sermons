A00003,2,"<i> Wheresoeuer the body is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together. </i>"
A00003,3,"THAT <i> Adam </i> did eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree, by faith we constantly beleeue it, by experience we wofully lament it."
A00003,3,"But the <NOTE> <i> species, </i> or kinde of fruit that he did eat; if it were a Pomegranate, or a Fig;"
A00003,3,"if it were a Grape, or an Apple, holy Scripture hath not expressed."
A00003,3,"The substance of his fault, that he did eat, is recorded;"
A00003,3,"but the circumstance, what kinde of fruit he did eat, is not at all reuealed. That lawlesse eating hath occasioned a lawfull iudgement;"
A00003,3,which Christ in the Gospell hath positiuely declared;
A00003,3,"but the time when, and place where that iudgement shall be, is not by him in any place disclosed:"
A00003,3,"And therefore when his Disciples would haue pressed him to it, by a bold, and curious question, <i> Where shall it be Lord? </i>"
A00003,3,"our Sauiour in my Text shapeth such an answer, that needs an explication:"
A00003,3,"Intimating thereby Gods counsels to be as deepe waters, which mortall men may not thinke to draine in the hollow of their hands."
A00003,3,"<i> Vbicunque fuerit corpus </i> (saith hee) <i> wheresoeuer the body is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together. </i>"
A00003,4,"<i> Dauid </i> prophesied of Christ, <NOTE> <i> Aperiam in parabolis os meum: </i> that his lips should distill parables. In this Text in part his prophesie is fulfilled:"
A00003,4,"And parables haue in them what <i> Fulgentius </i> generally applyeth to the Scriptures; <NOTE> <i> Et quod robustus comedat, & quod parvulus sugat: </i>"
A00003,4,"Meat for the great ones, milke for the weake ones: And that of <NOTE> <i> Gregory </i> agreeth with euery parable;"
A00003,4,"That which may nourish the little ones, <i> habet in publico; </i>"
A00003,4,"That which suspendeth with admiration the profoundest wits, <i> seruat in secreto: </i> It is a deepe, and yet a shallow Ford:"
A00003,4,"<i> vbi Agnus ambulet, vbi Elephas natet; </i> where the Lambe may wade, the Elephant may swim:"
A00003,4,"Therein are mysteries to exercise the prudent, and histories to giue vnderstanding to the simple."
A00003,5,"Some parables the holy Ghost <NOTE> in the Scripture hath written within, and without: expressed, and expounded;"
A00003,5,"and that partly by Christ himselfe: as that of the seed, and some others; and partly by the Apostles, but chiefly by Saint <i> Iohn; </i>"
A00003,5,"who was both <i> scriptor, </i> and <i> interpres, </i> (as learned <NOTE> <i> Tonstall </i> styles him) he thought not fit to passe ouer the sayings of our Lord <i> surda aure; </i>"
A00003,5,but recorded what our Sauiour spake; expounded what he recorded: For a view whereof take these ensuing particulars. expressed. expounded. Ioh. 2.19.
A00003,6,"<i> Destroy this Temple, and in three dayes I will raise it. </i> Ioh. 2.22. <i> This hee spake of the Temple of his body. </i> Ioh. 6.55."
A00003,6,"<i> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drinke indeed. </i> Ioh. 6.63. <i> It is the spirit that quickneth, the flesh profiteth nothing. </i> Ioh. 7.38."
A00003,6,"<i> He that beleeueth on me, out of his belly shall flow riuers of running water. </i> Ioh. 7.39."
A00003,6,"<i> This hee spake of the Spirit, which the beleeuers should receiue. </i> Ioh. 12.32."
A00003,6,"<i> And I, if I be lifted vp, will draw all after me. </i> Ioh. 12.33. <i> This he spake, signifying what death he should die. </i>"
A00003,7,"Now as we are happy in these infallible expositions of Christ, and his Eagle: so hence are our teares;"
A00003,7,"that this Text (a parabolicall prouerbe) hath deserued that worth, twice to be recorded by two seuerall Euangelists;"
A00003,7,and yet not once to be illuminated by any diuine exp•sition.
A00003,7,"Insomuch that the <NOTE> bread thereof, that is, the meaning, is to be eaten in the sweat of our studies."
A00003,7,"I may say of it, what <NOTE> <i> Hierome </i> did of the seuen short Epistles of the foure Apostles; tis mysticall, and succinct: <i> brevis pariter, & longa; </i> short, and yet long:"
A00003,7,"<i> brevis in verbis, longa in sententijs; </i>"
A00003,7,"short in words, long in the diuers, but not aduerse expositions thereof:"
A00003,7,"And of them I shall deliuer none other then those, which the ancient E•gles of the Church haue deliuered;"
A00003,7,and which may methodically be reduced to foure generall Expositions:
A00003,7,"In the progresse whereof, O God my Redeemer, that <i> hast the key of Dauid, openest where no man shutteth; shuttest where no man openeth: </i>"
A00003,7,"Thou that openedst thy mouth in parables, open the mouth of mee the speaker;"
A00003,7,that this parable may at this time be opened to this Assembly. The first Exposition.
A00003,8,"THe first that occurres vnto me (and for the Authors antiquitie first to be discussed) is <NOTE> <i> Origens, </i> who hath sensed the bodie to be the Church; the Eagles the Doctors;"
A00003,8,"the gathering together, <i> sensus, </i> and <i> consensus; </i> the harmonie, vnitie, and consent in points of faith. And to that in <NOTE> <i> Matthew, </i> this is very probable: where Christ premonisheth his Disciples;"
A00003,8,"<i> Take heed that no man deceiue you, </i> vers. 4."
A00003,8,"<i> Many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceiue many, </i> vers. 5. <i> Many false Prophets shall arise, and deceiue many, </i> vers. 11."
A00003,8,Then our Lord prescribes rules how to auoyd them:
A00003,8,"<i> If any man shall say, Loe here is Christ, or there is Christ, beleeue it not, </i> vers. 23."
A00003,8,"If they shall say, <i> Ecce in deserto; </i> behold he is in the desart, <i> Goe not forth: </i>"
A00003,8,"<i> behold he is in the secret chambers; beleeue it not, </i> vers. 26."
A00003,8,"Then hee demonstrates as it were with a finger, where he is, that is, where the Eagles are:"
A00003,8,"marke their flight, it guides you to the light: for <i> vbicunque fuerit corpus, &c. </i> <i> Secretae Scripturae rectè Solitudines appellantur: </i>"
A00003,9,Scripture secretly expounded is a secret wildernesse. <i> Basilides </i> (saith <i> Origen </i>) tells me Christ is here:
A00003,9,"<i> Marcion, </i> he is in the secret chambers: <i> Valentinus, </i> behold he is in the desart:"
A00003,9,and bring Scripture with solitarie expositions to confirme their singular opinions.
A00003,9,"But I beleeue them not, <NOTE> and repaire for the Catholike veritie to the Church, where the pasturing Eagles are."
A00003,10,No Scripture (saith <NOTE> <i> S. Peter </i>) is of a priuate interpretation;
A00003,10,"which is to be vnderstood, not <i> ratione personae, </i> but <i> ratione modi: </i>"
A00003,10,"A priuate man may expound, but not in a priuate manner;"
A00003,10,"by stamping new expositions vpon holy writ, diuers <i> ab Ecclesiae consortio </i> <NOTE>."
A00003,10,It is profane to eat the Paschall Lambe out of this house;
A00003,10,to gather the flowers of interpretation without the limits of the Churches garden.
A00003,10,"If any Father, or Doctor, shall broach any solitarie exposition against the Torrent of the Church; we reiect it;"
A00003,10,"<NOTE> it being the property of the faithfull, to receiue the Eagles with the body; the Doctors with the Church;"
A00003,10,and not to forsake the faith of the Church with the Doctors.
A00003,11,"<i> Ex personis probamus fidem, an ex fide personas? </i> Doth the faith depend vpon the persons; or the credit of the persons vpon the faith?"
A00003,11,"We ought therefore to embrace, what the Church holdeth; The Church to hold, what the Apostles haue deliuered;"
A00003,11,"The Apostles hauing deliuered, what Christ taught; who taught nothing but what he receiued of the Father; as <NOTE> <i> Tertullian </i> iustly prescribes."
A00003,12,"<i> Origen </i> himselfe, whose house was <NOTE> <i> illustrata martyrio, </i> famous for martyrdome, himselfe adorned <i> totius doctrinae magnificentia, </i> with all the magnificence of learning;"
A00003,12,"yet when hee began to set on foot priuate <i> Tenets, </i> and <i> Glosses: </i>"
A00003,12,"<NOTE> As, that the paines of the damned should not be eternall;"
A00003,12,and that Christ should be crucified in the ayre againe for the deuils; as he was on earth for man;
A00003,12,"herein we reiect this Eagle, because hee was not gathered to the body."
A00003,13,"<NOTE> <i> Tertullian </i> a worthy Ancient, famous for his Apologies for the Christians; for his writings for the Christian faith;"
A00003,13,whom <i> S. Cyprian </i> reuerently esteemed as his master;

A00003,13,who held themselues equall to the Apostles in diuine reuelations; we say; <i> Hic magister non tenetur; </i>
A00003,13,"and herein reiect this Eagle, as gone out from the body."
A00003,14,"But when the lightning shall shine from the East vnto the West, when the West and Easterne Eagles, the Doctors of the Greeke, and Latine Church shall meet in one harmonicall center of agreement;"
A00003,14,as they did in the foure first Generall Councels;
A00003,14,we thinke it more then common insolencie to dissent from them:
A00003,14,"But when the lightning hath shone in the West, and darknesse vpon the face of the East:"
A00003,14,"and when the Westerne Eagles shall decline from the Church, wee leaue those, and cleaue to them that are gathered to the bodie."
A00003,15,"<i> S. Hierome </i> in his time complaines to <i> Damasus, </i> how the <NOTE> Eagles of the East had degenerated:"
A00003,15,"nothing but weeds, sowre grapes, thornes, and thistles growing in their garden:"
A00003,15,"therefore hee had his recourse to the Sunne, that then shone in the Westerne Church:"
A00003,15,"not the depth of the seas, not the length of the earth, could separate him from this light, for sayes he, <i> Wheresoeuer the body is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together. </i>"
A00003,16,But as his complaint was of the corruption of the East;
A00003,16,"we iustly resume it, bewayling the now declined estate of the Westerne Church:"
A00003,16,"That the Eagle of Rome, the Patriarke of the Occidentall Church, hath taken her flight from her body; lamentably musing with the Prophet;"
A00003,16,"<i> How is the faithfull Citie become a harlot. </i> Rome, ancient Rome, <NOTE> famoused more for thy religion, then conquests:"
A00003,16,"sacked thou art of thy pretious margarite of faith, and veritie:"
A00003,16,"That thy Pope is <NOTE> <i> alius à Christo, </i> another from Christ, we doubt not:"
A00003,16,"But if <i> alius ab Antichristo, </i> another from Antichrist, we deseruedly call it into question."
A00003,17,"The like complaint make we of the inferiour Eagles of Rome, of their new deuised expositions to vphold their drooping, and dying cause:"
A00003,17,"To instance but in one, (who is in stead of all) Cardinall <i> Bellarmine, </i> who hath translated Christ into the Pope:"
A00003,17,"That Stone, that corner Stone, that pretious corner Stone, and sure found•tion, which <NOTE> <i> Esay </i> the Prophet foretold:"

A00003,17,"<NOTE> <i> Peter kill and eat, ergo Peter </i> was Head of the Church: Therefore wee reiect this, and such Eagles;"
A00003,17,because they haue not kept them to the body.
A00003,18,"And hereby we descry the Brownists, and Separatists to be no Eagles:"
A00003,18,those erring starres that haue no fixed motion in the Churches <i> orbe; </i>
A00003,18,"who in stead of reso•ting to the body, doe cut off themselues from vs by a schismaticall rent."
A00003,19,"<NOTE> <i> S. Chrysostome </i> obserueth, that our Sauiour saith not, <i> exite; </i> but <i> nolite credere: </i> goe you out; but beleeue them not:"
A00003,19,"But like an expert Captaine, prohibites all excursions from the Churches bounds, <i> nolite exire, </i> goe not out: Beleeue them not, auoid heresie:"
A00003,19,"Goe not out, take heed of schisme: Say our Church be deformed, yet shee is not infectious:"
A00003,19,Say the chaffe is mingled with the wheat;

A00003,19,Let your salt of doctrine season the Church with a peacefull vnion:

A00003,28,The passion of Christ (saith <i> S. Austen </i>) was the sleepe of his Diuinitie:

A00003,28,"In the passion, the Humanitie was forsaken of the Deity, but apparently; the body of the soule really:"
A00003,28,"Life was separated, yet the <i> Hypostasis </i> remained."

A00003,29,"double in power, in the assumption of the humanity: double in act, in the dissolution of the humane nature."
A00003,30,"Thus we see the body without a soule by death, but not without the Godhead: disiointed, not disunited:"

A00003,39,That in these words an adumbration of the last iudgement is contained:

A00003,39,"The body then is Christ the Iudge, the Eagles are the Saints, the gathering together is the generall Iudgement:"

A00003,40,"and so is fulfilled that of the Apostle, The stone which the builders not onely <i> improbauerunt, </i> but <i> reprobauerunt, </i> not disliked, but vtterly refused, is become the head stone in the corner."
A00003,41,"In the <NOTE> fifth of <i> Iohn, the Father iudgeth no man, but hath committed all iudgement to the Sonne: </i>"

A00003,41,"here I see <i> Patrem vacantem, Filiū iudicantē: </i> the Father at leasure, in vacation;"
A00003,41,"the Sonne iudging in a full Court, <NOTE> (Lord) thou art the profound word of the Father, I am shallow man, & vnderstand thee not: ("
A00003,41,Blessed Sauiour) I heare thee speaking of thy selfe;

A00003,41,"<i> turbamur hic, turbati desudemus, desudantes purgemur: </i>"
A00003,41,"we are troubled here, being troubled, we sweat to enucleate the mystery, and in descrying thereof we are purged."
A00003,41,"All iudgement is therefore giuen to the Son, not that the Father will cease to iudge:"
A00003,41,"But because <i> Pater occultus erit, Filius manifestus: </i> The Father shall iudge, but not be seene to iudge;"
A00003,41,"the Sonne shall iudge, and be seene to iudge: because he shall iudge in the habit of a man."
A00003,42,"<NOTE> <i> Him, </i> saith the Apostle, <i> hath God ordained to be Iudge of the quick, & dead: </i> where you may see his commission, & his circuit:"
A00003,42,"his commission, deriued from the King of Kings: <i> Constitutus à Deo: </i> him hath God ordained: his circuit, the largest that euer was; Iudge of quicke and dead:"

A00003,42,"Of the dead before, and of those that are found aliue at the resurrection; <NOTE> <i> for we shall not all die, but shall be changed; </i> so <i> Caietan. </i>"
A00003,42,"Large it must then needs bee, that is extended vnto all."
A00003,43,"We see then by this time, what we are to answer to that Question discussed in the Schooles:"
A00003,43,"If Christ in <i> forma humana, </i> shall iudge the world:"
A00003,43,"out of doubt hee shall come againe in the same manner, that he went from vs into heauen:"
A00003,43,"<NOTE> <i> Veniet, & sic veniet, </i> wi•h a body, with the same bodie, the s•me body, with the same skarres: as <i> Chrysostome </i> teacheth."
A00003,44,<i> He hath giuen all iudgement vnto the Sonne: </i>
A00003,44,"the Father could not giue it to the Sonne as God, which was his owne by nature;"
A00003,44,"neither could Christ receiue that, which as God he neuer wanted:"
A00003,44,"<NOTE> But the Father hath giuen, and th• Sonne receiued as man: as man shall hee come in the Clouds;"
A00003,44,as man shall he sit vpon the throne; as man sh•ll he denounce the sentence; as man shall he be seene of all:
A00003,44,the Godhead shall bee perspicuous to the godly onely:
A00003,44,"But Christ as man, shall lye open to all mens eyes;"
A00003,44,"to the faithfull, to the vnfaithfull, <i> confusis, & confisis, </i> to the confessors, to the crucifiers:"
A00003,44,"according to that of the Prophet, <NOTE> <i> They shall looke on him whom they haue pierced. </i> Christ as God, <NOTE> iudgeth with the Father in common; as man, alone:"
A00003,45,"some workes there be which Christ doth <i> in carne, </i> and yet cooperateth with the Father:"
A00003,45,"Some workes which he doth <i> per carnem, </i> wherein he worketh alone, and the Father by him:"
A00003,45,"as we say truly <i> Maries </i> Sonne created the world, Christ <i> in carne </i> created the world, but not <i> per carnem, </i> by the flesh."
A00003,45,"So Christ in the flesh, raised <i> Lazarus; </i> but not by the flesh."
A00003,45,"So Christ suffered by the flesh, (for the Deity could not be touched with passion) but triumphed in the flesh:"
A00003,45,So the Father and He as one God shall iudge together in the flesh; but not by the flesh:
A00003,45,in which respect as man he shall iudge alone. <NOTE> <i> Aquinas </i> giues three reasons for it.
A00003,47,"First, for the conueniency, most sutable to man, to be iudged by man. Secondly, for the equitie:"
A00003,48,"Good reason Christ should iudge man, who for man, was iudged by man:"
A00003,48,"<i> Sedebit Iudex, qui stetit sub Iudice, </i> <NOTE> <i> damnabit reos, qui falso factus est reus: </i>"
A00003,48,"There shall he sit to iudge, who stood here to be iudged;"
A00003,48,"& condemne the guilty, who falsly was accused to be guilty. Thirdly, because good, and bad are to be iudged:"
A00003,49,"Now the wicked were not to behold the Godhead, in the presence whereof there is fulnesse of ioy;"
A00003,49,therefore was Christ to iudge as man.
A00003,50,"This question in Schooles begets another, <i> viz. </i> whether, this iudiciall power were giuen to Christ, as man, freely, or purchased by his merits?"
A00003,50,"The Schoole-men answer, that it was giuen to him, <i> gratia capitis, </i> by the grace of personall vnion:"
A00003,50,"For when God assumed man, he infused into the Humane nature all those graces the Humanitie was capable of;"
A00003,50,and yet they say it was merited by him too. He humbled himselfe to the lowest;
A00003,50,therefore God hath exalted him to the highest. <NOTE> What hindreth (saith <i> Tho. </i>
A00003,50,"<i> Aquin•• </i> but that one and the same thing may be due by a double title; of gift, and purchase?"
A00003,50,"Christ on earth was both <i> viator, </i> and <i> comprehe•sor: extra•er•num, </i> and <i> in termino; </i> abroad and yet at home:"
A00003,50,"therefore being in a meritorious estate, and his merits of an infinite value what was it that hee could not m•rit? <NOTE> <i> Bonaue•ture </i> makes a twofold merit: 1."
A00003,50,Whereby a thing is due which was not due before. 2. Whereby it is due more wayes then it was before.
A00003,50,"The <i> praemium substantiale, </i> though it were giuen him by grace, and so due:"
A00003,50,"yet he might purchase it by his merits, and so make it more wayes due then it was before."
A00003,51,"Thus we see all things plead for Christ to be the Iudge: It belongs vnto him essentially, as God:"
A00003,51,"personally, as giuen from the Father:"
A00003,51,"and meritoriously, whereby Christ, by vertue of his merits may deseruedly claime it. So haue wee seene the body, Christ the Iudge:"
A00003,51,"I proceed to <i> th• ••gles, </i> the parties to be iudged. By ◊ <i> Eagl•s </i> are meant the Saints:"
A00003,52,And of those Saints there is a fourefold exposition related by <NOTE> <i> Maldonatus. </i>
A00003,53,"The first is the blessed Soules, which en•oy Christ now in heauen, of whom <i> S. Iohn </i> speaketh, <NOTE> <i> They follow the Lambe whither-soeuer he goeth. </i> The Lambe is <i> the body: </i>"

A00003,54,"The second, the Saints that then shall be found aliue at the R•surrection:"
A00003,54,"<NOTE> <NOTE> <i> Then we which are aliue, and remaine, shall be caught •p together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the ayre, and so shall we be euer with the Lord. </i> And againe;"

A00003,54,"Hereupon many of the <NOTE> Ancient haue thought, that some at that day shall passe without death to life;"
A00003,54,"though <i> Dauid </i> say, <i> Lord, who is that man, that shall not see death? Shall he deliuer himselfe from the power of the graue? </i>"
A00003,54,"And the Apostle tells vs, that it is a statute agreed vpon in the Parliament of heauen;"

A00003,57,"Thus we see all agree, that by <i> the Eagles </i> are meant the Saints only:"
A00003,57,"therefore he saith not the Vultures, or such foule Fowles, though it be their property likewise; but the Eagles are gathered:"

A00003,58,"Tis true, the Eagles doe not rise alone, but they shall be gathered alone."
A00003,58,"The Vultures shall appeare, the wicked shall arise, but to condemnation. Damnable is that Rabbinicall conceit;"
A00003,58,"that none shall rise, but those that shall be saued."

A00003,66,"The sword is turned to the word, persecuting into preaching;"
A00003,66,"and he that breathed out threatnings against the men of God, breathes out Gods threatnings against the men of this world:"
A00003,66,and so was renewed like vnto the Eagle.
A00003,67,The third is in the clearenesse of vision: The Eagles can looke vpon the Sunne: <NOTE> The pure in heart can see God:
A00003,67,"but the light shineth in darknesse, and the darknesse comprehendeth it not."
A00003,67,"Our Lord <NOTE> pronounceth the Disciples eyes to be h•pp•, <i> Bl•••ed are the •yes that se• the things that you see, &c. </i>"
A00003,67,"A speciall prerogatiue that hath beene d•n••d to Kings, and Kings desiring to see: to Prophets, and many Prophets, which hau• not seene them. <NOTE> <i> Beat••on quia diuites, &c. </i>"

A00003,67,and shall see your Sauiour come to iudgement. The fourth resemblance is in their lofty flight:
A00003,68,"<NOTE> <i> Doth not the Eagle mount vp, </i> <NOTE> <i> and make her n••• on high, </i> saith <i> Iob. </i>"
A00003,68,"So is it with the S•ints, as their conuersation, so their contemplation is as high as heauen:"
A00003,68,"Humble hearts, yet lofty thoughts, that reach the skies."
A00003,68,"<NOTE> <i> S. Bernard </i> obserues, that in the glasse of contemplation there are three steps to the diuine vision: 1. <i> Ascensus: </i> 2. <i> Excessus: </i> 3."
A00003,68,"<i> Raptus: </i> The first naturall, whereby the Philosophers in the Glasse of the Creatures haue ascended to the knowledge of one Creator."
A00003,68,"The second of grace, whereby the faithfull in the glasse of the Scriptures, know God as their Creator, and Redeemer."
A00003,68,"The third of glory, when the Saints shall see him face to face, as <i> Paul </i> that was caught into the third heauens, and there heard words not to be expressed. <i> Prima visio optat: Secunda odorat: Tertia gustat. </i>"
A00003,68,The vision of nature wisheth for that of grace: That of grace doth but salute that of glory:
A00003,68,But in that of glory shall we see and taste how gratious the Lord is. The last resemblance is in the secrecy of the way:
A00003,69,"One of those things which the Wise-man admired, was <NOTE> <i> the way of the Eagle in the ayre: </i> <NOTE> See them flie we may; discerne their way we cannot."
A00003,69,"The Saints, their good workes are seene of men, but their intention, with what minde they doe them, is not discerned."
A00003,69,"<NOTE> <i> S. Gregory </i> notes, that our Sauiour saith;"
A00003,69,"<i> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, &c. </i>"
A00003,69,"yet he addeth againe, <i> Take heed that you doe not righteousnesse to be seene of men; </i>"
A00003,69,"which he reconcileth, <i> sic opus fiat in publico, vt intentio maneat in secreto: </i> Let your good workes shine, but not your intention. Seeke not your owne glory;"
A00003,69,but that the spectators may glorifie your Father which is in heauen.
A00003,69,Thus haue we viewed these fainted Ea-Nothing letteth but that now we may passe to the <i> gathering together. </i>
A00003,70,"In the vnfolded parable of the Sower, the reapers are the Angels, <NOTE> which shall <i> gather the wheat into his garner, </i> that is, the elect into his kingdome;"
A00003,70,"and in another place, the <NOTE> <i> Elect shall be gathered from the foure corners of the world: </i>"
A00003,70,"The world, the corners, the vtmost coasts thereof shall be searched, that the Saints may be collected."
A00003,70,"The Eagle of a most swift slight, this gathering shall be speedy;"
A00003,70,"<i> In a moment, in the tw•nckling of an eye, at the last trumpe. </i>"
A00003,70,"And the Apostle, <NOTE> <i> Raptemur in nubibus, </i> we shall be caught together in the clouds:"
A00003,70,as the lightning that cutteth the <i> Hemisphaere </i> from the East to the West in a moment;
A00003,70,"so shall the comming of the Iudge be, such shall the gathering together of the Eagles be."
A00003,71,"Here by the way, I may not scatter, what <NOTE> <i> Ferus </i> hath gathered:"
A00003,71,"How the godly are said in holy Scripture to be gathered, and the wicked to be dispersed."
A00003,71,"<i> Gather thy Saints together, </i> (saith the Prophet.)"
A00003,71,"<NOTE> <i> Let God arise, and his enemies shall be dispersed, </i> saith the same Prophet."
A00003,71,The wicked are as chaffe which the winde shall scatter.
A00003,71,<NOTE> The godly are as the Eagles which shall be gathered together:
A00003,71,"The memory of the wicked is likened vnto ashes, because of their dispersion: but the iust shall be had in perpetuall remembrance. But the <i> place. </i>"
A00003,72,"The place is that the Disciples most desired to know, in which they are least resolued;"
A00003,72,"no set place set downe where these Assises shall be holden, but generally intimated, <i> Vbicunque &c. </i> <NOTE> <i> S. Hilaries </i> opinion is;"
A00003,73,"That he shall there iudge the world, where he suffered for the world. <i> Illic claritatis adventus expectabitur &c: </i>"
A00003,73,Most fit that his glory should be there splendent; where it was most dazled with ignominie:
A00003,73,"where hee dyed as a malefactor, thereto iudge malefactors: where the Crosse was, there the Tribunall to be."
A00003,73,"Therefore he saith, <i> Where the dead body is, </i> there shall be this gathering, this assembly."
A00003,74,"The Schoole-men generally affirme, That the place shall be the valley of <i> Iehoshaphat, </i> grounding themselues vpon that of <i> Ioel; </i>"
A00003,74,"<NOTE> <i> I will gather all nations together, and will bring them downe into the valley of Iehoshaphat, will plead their cause &c. </i>"
A00003,74,"And <NOTE> <i> Ribera </i> is so vehement for this opinion, that he demands, <i> Qua fronte? </i> With what a face any can reiect it?"
A00003,74,"It being so sutable to the letter, that <NOTE> we shall haue no certainty in the Scripture, if we forsake it."
A00003,75,"That there is such a valley knowne by that name, on the Nor•h-side of <i> Hierusalem, </i> and at the foot of Mount Oliuet, Historians relate."
A00003,75,"But why it hath that denomination, seeing <i> Iehosaphat </i> was not there buried, but in the Citie of <i> Dauid, </i> none of them declar•."
A00003,76,"<NOTE> <i> Aquinas </i> after he had said what the Iesuite out of him hath repeated, and somewhat more;"
A00003,76,"yet doth not certainly determine, but probably coniecture that to be the place."
A00003,77,"And with <i> Riberaes </i> leaue, it is more consonant to the literall sense;"
A00003,77,"That God will deliuer his people from the hands of the <i> Assyrians, </i> to whom they were now captiuated:"
A00003,77,"And that hee might comfort them the more, he doth allude to that miraculous victorie <NOTE> that God gaue to <i> Iehosaphat. </i>"
A00003,77,"For listen <i> Ribera, </i> as the Lord did then cause a ciuill discord, and mutinie to arise in the Enemies campe, wherein the children of <i> Ammon </i> destroyed those of Mount <i> Seir, </i> therefore the place was called the valley of <i> Beracah, </i> or blessing:"
A00003,77,"So is the Lord able to deliuer you out of the <i> Assyrian </i> yoke, and to gather you from among the Nations."
A00003,78,"Therefore whether Christ shall iudge in the ayre, or on the earth, in Mount <i> Caluary, </i> or in the Valley of <i> I•hosaphat, </i> we place it <i> inter scita Scholae, </i> to be discussed in School•s, not <i> inter articulos fidei, </i> to be imbraced as an Article of our beleefe."
A00003,79,"The circumstance of the place, <i> where, </i> m•kes me call to minde the time <i> when </i> the day of iudgement shall be, which is •s much or more vncertaine then the former, so sealed vp, that <NOTE> <i> of that day, and houre knoweth no man, no not the Ang•ls </i> (saith our Lord) <i> but my Father onely: </i>"
A00003,79,It transcendeth the knowl•dge of man: It transcendeth the knowledge of Angels;
A00003,79,"and (as it seemeth by Saint <i> Mark• </i> of the Sonne too; who addes, <NOTE> <i> not the Sonne, but the Father. </i>"
A00003,79,"Of man there is no maruaile, who is ignorant of many things he is bound to know:"
A00003,79,Neither is there any great scruple of th• Angels;
A00003,79,"for though they see him that seeth all things, yet in him they doe not see all things, but thos• obiects that concurre to their <i> Beatitude; </i>"
A00003,79,as the <NOTE> Schoole-men haue bounded that <NOTE> too too large spe•ch of <i> Gregory. </i>
A00003,80,"All th• doubt, all the scruple, and difficultie lyeth in Christ, how he should be said not to know the day of iudgement:"
A00003,80,"Some haue thought this clause <i> (neque filius) </i> to haue beene crowded into the Text by the <i> Arrians, </i> and <i> Agnoaetae. </i>"
A00003,81,<NOTE> <i> S. Gregory ad Eulogium </i> layeth downe three expositions of the Fathers.
A00003,82,"The first is, that it is not to be referred to Christ the head, but vnto vs the body;"
A00003,82,as in the Scripture by reason of the mysticall vnion things are;
A00003,82,"<i> viz. Whatsoeuer you doe vnto these, you doe it vnto me. </i>"
A00003,82,"So it will be, Christ knew it not in his members, that is, the Church knew it not."
A00003,82,But this is iustly discarded by <NOTE> <i> Bellarmine: </i>
A00003,82,"for if Christ had not knowne it but in his members; why doth hee adde <i> no man, no not the Angels; </i>"
A00003,82,"seeing men, and Angels are members of the mysticall body."
A00003,83,"Secondly, he knew it not, because he hath not made vs to know it: As God said to <i> Abraham; </i>"
A00003,83,<NOTE> <i> Now I know thou fearest me; </i>
A00003,83,"that is, I haue made thee, and all that know thee, for to know it:"
A00003,83,"As we say, now the Sunne shineth clearely, now it is darkned:"
A00003,83,not that euer claritie is separated from the body of the Sunne;
A00003,83,"but that sometimes his light, and beames are withdrawne from vs. So we say, it is a ioyfull, or sorrowfull day:"
A00003,83,"not in it selfe, but because it is to vs either ioyfull, or sorrowfull."
A00003,83,"So our Sauiour knew not th•s day, because he hath not made vs to know it."
A00003,84,"Thirdly, Christ knew this day <i> in natura humanitatis, </i> but not <i> ex natura humanitatis: </i> The man-Christ knew it; but not as man:"
A00003,84,"<i> in ipsa, </i> but not <i> ex ipsa; </i> in the manhood, but not by the manhood; but speciall priuiledge of reuelation."
A00003,85,"The <NOTE> Schoole-men tell vs of a twofold knowledge in Christ; <i> in verbo, </i> and <i> in genere proprio: </i>"
A00003,85,"The first, whereby he seeth all things in the eternall Word: The second, whereby he seeth them in themselues: And this againe is twofold; either <i> infused, </i> or <i> acquisite: </i>"
A00003,85,"His infused knowledge was powred into his manhood in the act of his conception, when all knowledge the finite creature could be capabl• of, was granted vnto him, wh•reby he discerned all things."
A00003,85,"But besides this, he had an acquisite, and <i> experimentall </i> knowledge;"
A00003,85,whereby experience acquainted him with many things that practically he knew not before.
A00003,85,"And in this respect (if in any) may he be said not to know the day of iudgement. <NOTE> One thing more occurres vnto mee: Christ saith not, <i> Vbique corpus; </i> but <i> Vbicunque; </i>"
A00003,86,"not that his body is <i> euery where, </i> but <i> wheresoeuer: </i>"
A00003,86,"As he tooke on him the nature of man, so that nature was finite, had all the properties of a created natur•;"
A00003,86,"therefore had an <i> vbi, </i> was contained within the limits, the <i> superficies, </i> and bounds of place. Therefore <i> locall motions </i> are ascribed vnto him in the Scripture;"
A00003,86,"where he is said to descend, and ascend, and goe vnto the Father. And after his resurrection; <i> Surrexit, non est hic; </i>"
A00003,86,He is risen he is not here; therefore he is not <i> euery where. </i>
A00003,87,"The monstrous and new sprung error of <i> Vbi quitie </i> (as <NOTE> <i> Bellarmine </i> excellently obserueth) euerteth all the Articles of our Creed, that we beleeue touching the manhood of our Sauiour:"
A00003,87,"of his conception, how could he be contained within the straites of blessed <i> Maries </i> wombe, if hee be in all places?"
A00003,87,"how was he nayled to the Crosse, if euery where? how wrapped in linnen cloathes? how intombed in a Sepulchre?"
A00003,87,"if his body be so spacious that it knoweth no limits, how ascended he into heauen?"
A00003,87,and <NOTE> how doe the heauens containe him? if hee bee not contained in any compasse.
A00003,88,"It is true, we acknowledge a <i> Communication of properties, </i> and that not Rationall, but Reall; yet not of the natures, but personall vnion;"
A00003,88,"not <i> inherently </i> in the natur•s, but <i> personally </i> in the person of the Sonne of God:"
A00003,88,"So wee say that Christ is euery where, and that the Virgins Sonne created the world, <i> not by the propriety of natures, but by the communication of properties: </i> as <NOTE> <i> Bonauenture </i> acutely."
A00003,88,"Neither are we ignorant of that of the Apostle, <i> In him dwelleth the fulnesse of the Godhead bodily: </i>"
A00003,88,"yet it is one thing to <i> dwell, </i> and another thing to bee <i> communicated: </i>"
A00003,88,"because of a mans dwelling in a house, the house cannot bee said to goe, to speake, &c. but the man dwelling in the house:"
A00003,88,"so not the body euery where, but the Godhead dwelling in the body."
A00003,89,"There is a being of Essence, and a being of Subsistence: the Essence of the Humanity is finite, because a creature."
A00003,89,"But the being of subsistence hauing none of it owne, because it subsisteth in the person of the Sonne of God is infinit;"
A00003,89,so the finite humanity doth infinitely subsist in the Godhead;
A00003,89,and in a sense may be sayd to bee euery where:
A00003,89,"This with <i> Zanchy </i> doe I conceiue to be the mind of some of the Germane Diuines, and especially that learned <i> Chemnitius </i> <NOTE>."
A00003,90,"Christs body then is locally in one place, but personally in al places, <i> Salua vtriusque naturae proprietate, </i> saith the great Councell <NOTE> of <i> Calcedon, </i> it hath his <i> vbi, </i> not <i> vbique, </i> not euery where, but wheresoeuer: so saith my Text; <i> Vbicunque fuerit corpus, &c. </i>"
