Romans 5.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Romans,5,3,"And not only this; but also we glorie in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience:"
Romans 5.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Romans,5,4,"and patience, probation; and probation, hope;"

1 Corinthians 1.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,1,11,"For it is signified vnto me (my Brethren) of you, by them that are of Chloe, that there be contentions among you."

1 Corinthians 1.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,1,18,"For the word of the crosse, to them indeed that perish, is foolishnes; but to them that are saued, that is, to vs, it is the power of God."
1 Corinthians 1.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,1,19,For it is written: I wil destroy the wisedom of the wise; and the prudence of the prudent I wil reiect.
1 Corinthians 1.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,1,20,where is the wise? where is the Scribe? where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made the wisedom of this world foolish?
1 Corinthians 1.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,1,21,For because in the wisedom of God the world did not by wisedom know God; it pleased God by the foolishnes of the preaching to saue them that beleeue.
1 Corinthians 1.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,1,22,"For both the Iewes aske signes, and the Greeks seeke wisedom:"
1 Corinthians 1.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,1,23,"but we preach Christ crucified, to the Iewes certes a scandal, and to the Gentils, foolishnes:"

1 Corinthians 2.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,3,"And I was with you in infirmitie, and feare and much trembling:"
1 Corinthians 2.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,4,"and my speach and my preaching was not in the persuasible words of humane wisedom, but in shewing of spirit and power;"
1 Corinthians 2.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,5,"that your faith might not be in the wisedom of men, but in the power of God. But we speake wisedom among the perfect."
1 Corinthians 2.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,6,"But the wisedom not of this world, neither of the Princes of this world, that come to naught:"
1 Corinthians 2.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,7,"but we speake the wisedom of God in a mysterie, which is hid, which God did predestinate before the worlds, vnto our glorie:"
1 Corinthians 2.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,8,"which none of the Princes of this world did know: for if they had knowen, they would neuer haue crucified the Lord of glorie."
1 Corinthians 2.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,9,"But as it is written: That which eye hath not seen, nor eare hath heard, neither hath it ascended into the hart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that loue him."
1 Corinthians 2.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,10,"But to vs God hath reuealed by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth al things, yea the profundities of God."
1 Corinthians 2.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,11,"For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? so the things also that are of God no man knoweth, but the spirit of God."
1 Corinthians 2.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,12,"And we haue receiued not the spirit of this world, but the spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that of God are giuen to vs."
1 Corinthians 2.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,13,"Which also we speake not in learned words of humane wisedom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things to the spiritual."
1 Corinthians 2.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,14,"But the sensual man perceiueth not those things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishnes to him, and he can not vnderstand; because he is spiritually examined."
1 Corinthians 2.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,15,But the spiritual man iudgeth al things: and himself is iudged of no man.
1 Corinthians 2.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,2,16,For who hath knowen the sense of our Lord that may instruct him? But we haue the sense of Christ.
1 Corinthians 3.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,1,"AND I, Brethren, could not speake to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal. As it were to litle ones in Christ,"
1 Corinthians 3.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,2,"I gaue you milke to drinke, not meate: for you could not as yet. But neither can you now verily, for yet you are carnal."
1 Corinthians 3.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,3,"For whereas there is among you emulation and contention are you not carnal, and walke according to man?"
1 Corinthians 3.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,4,"For when one saith, I certes am Paules, & another, I Apollo's; are you not men? What is Apollo then? and what is Paul?"
1 Corinthians 3.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,5,"The Ministers of him whom you haue beleeued, and to euery one as our Lord hath giuen."

1 Corinthians 3.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,7,"Therfore neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth; but he that giueth the increase, God."
1 Corinthians 3.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,8,And he that planteth and he that watereth are one. And euery one shal receiue his owne reward according to his owne labour.
1 Corinthians 3.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,9,"For we are God's Coadiutours; you are God's husbandrie, you are God's building."
1 Corinthians 3.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,10,"According to the grace that is giuen me, as a wise Workemaster haue I laid the foundation: and another buildeth thereupon. But let euery one look how he buildeth thereon."
1 Corinthians 3.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,11,"For other foundation no man can lay, beside that which is laid; which is CHRIST IESVS."
1 Corinthians 3.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,12,"And if any build vpon this foundation, gold, siluer, pretious stones, wood, hay, stubble,"
1 Corinthians 3.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,13,"the worke of euery one shal be manifest: for the day of our Lord wil declare, because it shal be reuealed in fire: and the worke of euery one of what kind it is, the fire shal trie."

1 Corinthians 3.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,16,Know you not that you are the Temple of God; and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
1 Corinthians 3.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,17,"But if any violate the Temple of God, God wil destroy him. For the Temple of God is holy: which you are."
1 Corinthians 3.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no man seduce himself: if any man seeme to be wise among you in this world, let him become a foole that he may be wise."
1 Corinthians 3.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,19,For the wisedom of this world is foolishnes with God. For it is written: I wil compasse the wise in their subteltie.
1 Corinthians 3.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,20,"And againe, Our Lord knoweth the cogitations of the wise that they be vaine."
1 Corinthians 3.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,21,Let no man therfore glorie in men. For al things are yours:
1 Corinthians 3.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,22,"whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; for al are yours:"
1 Corinthians 3.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,3,23,"and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's."
1 Corinthians 4.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,1,"SO let a man esteeme vs as the Ministers of Christ, and the dispensers of the mysteries of God."
1 Corinthians 4.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,2,Here now is required among the dispensers that a man be found faithful.
1 Corinthians 4.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,3,"But to me it is a thing of least account, to be iudged of you, or of man's day: But I iudge not my-self neither."
1 Corinthians 4.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,4,"For I am not guilty in conscience of any thing; but I am not iustified herein: but he that iudgeth me, is our Lord."
1 Corinthians 4.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,5,"Therfore iudge not before the time; vntil our Lord doe come, who also wil lighten the hidden things of darknes, & wil manifest the counsels of the harts: & then the praise shal be to euery man of God."
1 Corinthians 4.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,6,"But these things, Brethren, I haue transfigured into my self and Apollo, for you; that in vs you may learne, one not to be puffed vp for one against another, aboue that is written."
1 Corinthians 4.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,7,For who discerneth thee? Or what hast thou that thou hast not receiued? And if thou hast receiued what doest thou glorie as though thou hast not receiued?
1 Corinthians 4.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,8,"Now you are filled, now are you become rich: without vs you reigne; & I would to God you did reigne, that we also might reigne with you."
1 Corinthians 4.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,9,"For I thinke that God hath shewed vs Apostles the last, as it were deputed to death: because we are made a spectacle to the world, and to Angels and men."
1 Corinthians 4.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,10,"We are fooles for Christ; but you wise in Christ. We weak; but you strong. You noble, but we base."

1 Corinthians 4.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,12,and labour working with our owne hands. We are cursed; and doe blesse. We are persecuted; and sustaine it.
1 Corinthians 4.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,13,"We are blasphemed; and we beseech. We are made the refuse of this world, the drosse of al euen vntil now."
1 Corinthians 4.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,14,"Not to confound you, doe I write these things; but as my deerest children I admonish you."
1 Corinthians 4.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,4,15,For if you haue ten thousand Paedagogues in Christ; yet not many Fathers. For in Christ IESVS by the Ghospel I begat you.

1 Corinthians 5.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,1,"THERE is plainely heard fornication among you, and such fornication, as the like is not among the Heathen, so that one hath his fathers wife."
1 Corinthians 5.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,2,"And you are puffed vp; and haue not mourned rather, that he might be taken away from among you, that hath done this deed."
1 Corinthians 5.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,3,"I indeed absent in body, but present in spirit, haue already iudged, as present, him that hath so done,"
1 Corinthians 5.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,4,"in the name of our Lord IESVS Christ, you being gathered together and my spirit, with the vertue of our Lord IESVS;"
1 Corinthians 5.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,5,"to deliuer such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saued in the day of our Lord IESVS Christ."
1 Corinthians 5.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,6,Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a litle leauen corrupteth the whole paste?
1 Corinthians 5.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,7,"Purge the old leauen, that you may be a new paste, as your are azymes. For our Pasche, Christ, is immolated."
1 Corinthians 5.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,8,"Therfore let vs feast, not in the old leauen, nor in the leauen of malice and wickednes, but in the azymes of sinceritie and veritie."
1 Corinthians 5.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,9,"I wrote to you in an epistle, not to keep companie with fornicatours."
1 Corinthians 5.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,10,"I meane not the fornicatours of this world, or the couetous, or the extorsioners, or seruers of Idols: otherwise you should haue gone out of this world."
1 Corinthians 5.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,11,"But now I wrote to you, not to keep companie, if he that is named a Brother, be a fornicatour, or a couetous person, or a seruer of Idols, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extorsioner: with such an one not so much as to take meat."
1 Corinthians 5.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,12,For what is it to me to iudge of them that are without? Doe not you iudge of them that are within?
1 Corinthians 5.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,5,13,"for them that are without, God wil iudge. Take away the euil one from among your selues."
1 Corinthians 6.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,1,"DARE any of you hauing a matter against another, to be iudged before the vniust, & not before the Saints?"
1 Corinthians 6.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,2,Or know you not that the Saints shal iudge of the world? And if the world shal be iudged by you: are you vnworthie to iudge of the least things?
1 Corinthians 6.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,3,Know you not that we shal iudge Angels? how much more secular things?
1 Corinthians 6.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,4,"If therfore you haue secular iudgements; the contemptible that are in the Church, set them to iudge."
1 Corinthians 6.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,5,"I speake to your shame. So is there not among you any wise man, that can iudge between his brother?"
1 Corinthians 6.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,6,But brother with brother contendeth in iudgement: & that before infidels?
1 Corinthians 6.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,7,"Now certes there is plainely a fault in you, that you haue iudgements among you. Why doe you not rather take wrong? why doe you not rather suffer fraud?"
1 Corinthians 6.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,8,But your selues doe wrong and defraud: and that to the Brethren.
1 Corinthians 6.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,9,"Know you not that the vniust shal not possesse the Kingdom of God? Doe not erre: Neither fornicatours, nor seruers of Idols, nor aduouterers, nor the effeminate, nor the liers with mankind,"
1 Corinthians 6.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,10,"nor theeues, nor the couetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extorsioners shal possesse the Kingdom of God."
1 Corinthians 6.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,11,"And these things certes you were, but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are iustified in the name of our Lord IESVS Christ, and in the Spirit of our God."

1 Corinthians 6.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,15,"Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Taking therfore the members of Christ, shal I make them the members of an harlot? God forbid."
1 Corinthians 6.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,16,"Or know you not, that he which cleaueth to an harlot, is made one body? For they shal be, saith he, two in one flesh."
1 Corinthians 6.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,17,"But he that cleaueth to our Lord, is one spirit."
1 Corinthians 6.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,18,"Fly fornication. Euery sinne whatsoeuer a man doeth, is without the body: but he that doth fornicate, sinneth against his owne body."
1 Corinthians 6.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,19,"Or know you not that your members are the temple of the holy Ghost which is in you, whome you haue of God, and you are not your owne."
1 Corinthians 6.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,6,20,For you are bought with a great price. Glorifie and beare God in your body.

1 Corinthians 7.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,2,"But because of fornication let euery man haue his owne wife, & let euery woman haue her owne husband."
1 Corinthians 7.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,3,Let the husband render his debt to the wife: and the wife also in like manner to her husband.
1 Corinthians 7.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,4,The woman hath not power of her owne body: but her husband. And in like manner the man also hath not power of his owne body; but the woman.
1 Corinthians 7.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,5,"Defraud not one another, except perhaps by consent for a time, that you may giue your self to praier: and returne againe together, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinencie."
1 Corinthians 7.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,6,"But I say this by indulgence, not by commandement."
1 Corinthians 7.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,7,"For I would al men to be as my self: but euery one hath a proper guift of God; one so, and another so."
1 Corinthians 7.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,8,But I say to the vnmarried and to widowes: It is good for them if they so abide euen as I also.
1 Corinthians 7.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if they doe not conteine themselues, let them marrie. For it is better to marrie then to be burnt."
1 Corinthians 7.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,10,"But to them that be ioyned in matrimonie, not I giue commandement, but our Lord, that the wife depart not from her husband:"
1 Corinthians 7.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,11,"and is she depart, to remaine vnmarried, or to be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife."
1 Corinthians 7.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,12,"For to the rest, I say, not our Lord. If any Brother haue a wife an infidel, and she consent to dwel with him; let him not put her away."
1 Corinthians 7.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,13,"And if any woman haue a husband an infidel, and he consent to dwel with her; let her not put away her husband."
1 Corinthians 7.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,14,For the man an infidel is sanctified by the faithful woman; and the woman an infidel is sanctified by the faithful husband: otherwise your children should be vncleane; but now they are holy.
1 Corinthians 7.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,15,"But if the infidel depart, let him depart. For the Brother or Sister is not subiect to seruitude in such. But in peace hath God called vs."
1 Corinthians 7.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,16,"For how knowest thou woman, if thou shalt saue thy husband? or how knowest thou man, if thou shalt saue the woman?"
1 Corinthians 7.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,17,"But to euery one as our Lord hath deuided, as God hath called euery one, so let him walke, and as in al Churches I teach."
1 Corinthians 7.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,18,Is any man called being circumcised? let him not procure prepuce. Is any man called in prepuce? let him not be circumcised.
1 Corinthians 7.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and prepuce is nothing: but the obseruation of the commandments of God."
1 Corinthians 7.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,20,"Euery one in the vocation that he was called, in it let him abide."
1 Corinthians 7.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,21,"Wast thou called being a bondman? care not for it: but and if thou canst be made free, vse it rather."
1 Corinthians 7.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,22,"For he that in our Lord is called, being a bondman, is the franchised of our Lord. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ."
1 Corinthians 7.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,23,"You were bought with price, be not made the bondmen of men."
1 Corinthians 7.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,24,"Euery Brother wherein he was called, in that let him abide before God."
1 Corinthians 7.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,25,"And as concerning virgins, a commandement of our Lord I haue not: but a counsel I giue, as hauing obteined mercie of our Lord to be faithful."
1 Corinthians 7.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,26,"I thinke therfore that this is good for the present necessitie, because it is good for a man so to be."
1 Corinthians 7.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,27,Art thou tied to a wife? seeke not to be loosed. Art thou loose from a wife? seeke not a wife.
1 Corinthians 7.28 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,28,"But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marrie, she hath not sinned. Neuerthelesse tribulation of the flesh shal such haue. But I spare you."
1 Corinthians 7.29 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,29,"This therfore I say, Brethren; the time is short, it remaineth, that they also which haue wiues, be as though they had not;"
1 Corinthians 7.30 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,30,"and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that reioyce, as though they reioyced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;"
1 Corinthians 7.31 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,31,"and they that vse this world, as though they vsed it not. For the figure of this world passeth away."
1 Corinthians 7.32 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I would haue you to be without carefulnes. He that is without a wife, is careful for the things that pertaine to our Lord, how he may please God."
1 Corinthians 7.33 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,33,"But he that is with a wife, is careful for the things that pertaine to the world, how he may please his wife: and he is deuided."
1 Corinthians 7.34 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,34,"And the woman vnmarried & the virgin, thinketh on the things that pertaine to our Lord: that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married, thinketh on the things that pertaine to the world, how she may please her husband."
1 Corinthians 7.35 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,35,"And this I speake to your profit: not to cast a snare vpon you, but to that which is honest, & that may giue you power without impediment to attend vpon our Lord."
1 Corinthians 7.36 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any man thinke that he seemeth deshonoured vpon his virgin, for that she is past age, and if it must so be, let him doe that he wil. He sinneth not if she marrie."
1 Corinthians 7.37 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,37,"For he that hath determined in his hart being settled, not hauing necessitie, but hauing power of his owne wil, and hath iudged this in his hart, to keep his virgin, doeth wel."
1 Corinthians 7.38 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,38,"Therfore both he that ioyneth his virgin in matrimonie, doeth wel: and he that ioyneth not, doeth better."
1 Corinthians 7.39 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,39,"A woman is bound to the law so long time as her husband liueth: but if her husband sleep, she is at libertie: let her marrie to whom she wil: only in our Lord."
1 Corinthians 7.40 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,7,40,"But more blessed shal she be if she so remaine, according to my counsel. And I thinke that I also haue the Spirit of God."
1 Corinthians 8.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,1,"AND concerning those things that are sacrificed to Idols, we know that we al haue knowledge. Knowledge puffeth vp; but charitie edifieth."
1 Corinthians 8.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,2,"And if any man thinke that he knoweth something, he hath not yet knowen, as he ought to know."
1 Corinthians 8.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if any man loue God, the same is knowen of him."
1 Corinthians 8.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,4,"But as for the meats that are immolated to Idols, we know that an Idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God, but one."
1 Corinthians 8.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,5,"For although there be that are called Gods, either in Heauen, or in earth (for there are many Gods, and many Lords)"
1 Corinthians 8.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,6,"yet to vs there is one God, the Father, of whom al things, and we vnto him: and one Lord IESVS CHRIST, by whom al things, and we by him."
1 Corinthians 8.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,7,"But there is not knowledge in al. For some vntil this present with a conscience of the Idol, eate as a thing sacrificed to Idols: and their conscience being weak, is polluted."
1 Corinthians 8.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,8,"But meate doth not commend vs to God. For neither if we eate, shal we abound: nor if we eate not, shal we lack."
1 Corinthians 8.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,9,But take heed lest perhapes this your libertie become an offense to the weake.
1 Corinthians 8.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,10,"For if a man see him that hath knowledge, sit at table in the Idol's Temple; shal not his conscience, being weake, be edified, to eate things sacrificed to Idols?"
1 Corinthians 8.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,11,"And though thy knowledge shal the weake Brother perish, for whom Christ hath died?"
1 Corinthians 8.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,12,"But sinning thus against the Brethren, and striking their weake conscience; you sinne against Christ."
1 Corinthians 8.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,8,13,"Wherfore if meate scandalize my Brother, I wil neuer eate flesh, lest I scandalize my Brother."
1 Corinthians 9.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,1,AM I not free? Am I not an Apostle? Haue I not seen Christ IESVS our Lord? Are not you my worke in our Lord?
1 Corinthians 9.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,2,"And if to others I be not an Apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seale of my Apostleship in our Lord."
1 Corinthians 9.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,3,my defense to them that examine me is this:
1 Corinthians 9.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,4,Haue not we power to eate and drinke?
1 Corinthians 9.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,5,"Haue we not power to lead about a woman a Sister, as also the rest of the Apostles, and our Lord's Brethren, and Cephas?"
1 Corinthians 9.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,6,Or I only and Barnabas haue not we power to doe this?
1 Corinthians 9.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,7,"Who euer plaieth the souldiar at his owne charges? who planteth a vine, and eateth not of the fruit therof? Who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milke of the flock?"
1 Corinthians 9.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,8,Speake I these things according to man? Or doth not the Law also say these things?
1 Corinthians 9.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,9,"For it is written in the Law of Moyses: Thou shalt not moosel the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne. Why, hath God care of oxen?"
1 Corinthians 9.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,10,"Or for vs certes doth he say it? For they are written for vs. Because he that eareth, ought to eare in hope: and he that treadeth, in hope to receiue fruit."
1 Corinthians 9.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,11,"If we haue sowen vnto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reape your carnal things?"
1 Corinthians 9.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,12,"If other be partakers of your power; why not we rather? Howbeit we haue not vsed, this power: but we beare al things, lest we should giue any offence to the Ghospel of Christ."
1 Corinthians 9.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,13,"Know you not that they which worke in the holy place, eate the things that are of the holy place: and they that serue the altar, participate with the altar?"
1 Corinthians 9.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,14,"So also our Lord ordained for them that preach the Ghospel, to liue of the Ghospel."
1 Corinthians 9.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I haue vsed none of these. Neither haue I written these things, that they should be so done in me; for it is good for me to die rather, then that any man should make my glorie void."
1 Corinthians 9.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,16,"For & if I euangelize, it is no glorie to me: for necessitie lieth vpon me: for woe is to me if I euangelize not."
1 Corinthians 9.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,17,"For if I doe this willingly, I haue reward: but if against my wil, a charge is committed to me."
1 Corinthians 9.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,18,"What is my reward then? That preaching the Ghospel, I yeald the Ghospel without cost, that I abuse not my power in the Ghospel."
1 Corinthians 9.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,19,"For whereas I was free of al, I made my self the seruant of al: that I might gaine the moe."
1 Corinthians 9.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,20,"And I became to the Iewes as a Iew, that I might gaine the Iewes."
1 Corinthians 9.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,21,"To them that are vnder the Law, as though I were vnder the Law (whereas my self was not vnder the Law) that I might gaine them that were vnder the Law. To them that were without the Law, as though I were without the Law (whereas I was not without the law of God, but was in the law of Christ) that I might gaine them that were without the Law."
1 Corinthians 9.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,22,"To the weake I became weake, that I might gaine the weake. To al men I became al things, that I might saue al."
1 Corinthians 9.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,23,"And I doe al things for the Ghospel, that I may be made partaker therof."
1 Corinthians 9.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,24,"Know you not that they that run in the race, al run indeed, but one receiueth the price? So run that you may obteine."
1 Corinthians 9.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,25,"And euery one the striueth for the maistrie, refraineth himself from al things: and they certes that they may receiue a corruptible crowne: but we an incorruptible."
1 Corinthians 9.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,26,"I therfore so run, not as it were at an vncertaine thing: so I fight, not as it were beating the aire:"
1 Corinthians 9.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,9,27,"But I chastise my body, and bring it into seruitude, lest perhaps when I haue preached to others, my self become reprobate."
1 Corinthians 10.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,1,"FOR I wil not haue you ignorant, Brethren, that our Fathers were al vnder the cloud, & al passed through the sea,"
1 Corinthians 10.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,2,and al in Moyses were baptized in the cloud and in the sea:
1 Corinthians 10.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,3,"and al did eate the same spiritual food,"
1 Corinthians 10.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,4,"and al drunke the same spiritual drinke (and they drunke of the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.)"
1 Corinthians 10.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,5,But in the more part of them God was not wel pleased. For they were ouerthrowen in the desert.
1 Corinthians 10.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,6,"And these things were done in a figure of vs, that we be not coueting euil things, as they also coueted."
1 Corinthians 10.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,7,"Neither become ye Idolaters, as certaine of them: as it written: The people sate downe to eate and drinke, and rose vp to play."
1 Corinthians 10.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,8,"Neither let vs fornicate, as certaine of them did fornicate, and there fel in one day three and twentie thousand."
1 Corinthians 10.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,9,"Neither let vs tempt Christ, as certaine of them tempted, and perished by the serpents."
1 Corinthians 10.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,10,"Neither doe you murmure, as certaine of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer."
1 Corinthians 10.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,11,"And al these things chanced to them in figure: but they are written to our correption, vpon whom the ends of the world are come."
1 Corinthians 10.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,12,"Therfore he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fal."
1 Corinthians 10.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,13,"Let no tentation apprehend you, but humane. And God is faithful, who wil not suffer you to be tempted aboue that which you are able: but wil make also with tentation issue that you may be able to susteine."
1 Corinthians 10.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,14,"For the which cause, my Dearest, fly from the seruing of Idols."
1 Corinthians 10.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,15,I speake as to wise men: your selues iudge what I say.
1 Corinthians 10.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,16,"The chalice of benediction which we doe blesse, is it not the communication of the bloud of Christ? and the bread which we break, is it not the participation of the body of our Lord?"
1 Corinthians 10.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,17,"For being many, we are one bread, one body, al that participate of one bread."
1 Corinthians 10.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,18,"Behold Israel according to the flesh: they that eate the Hosts, are they not partakers of the altar?"
1 Corinthians 10.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,19,"What then? doe I say that that which is immolated to Idols, is any thing? or that the Idol is any thing?"
1 Corinthians 10.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,20,"But the things that the Heathen doe immolate, to Diuels they doe immolate, and not to God. And I wil not haue you become fellowes of Diuels."
1 Corinthians 10.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,21,"You can not drinke the chalice of our Lord, and the chalice of Diuels: you can not be partakers of the table of our Lord, and of the table of Diuels."
1 Corinthians 10.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,22,"Or doe we emulate our Lord? Why, are we stronger then he? Al things are lawful for me, but al things are not expedient."

1 Corinthians 10.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,24,"Let no man seeke his owne, but another man's."
1 Corinthians 10.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,25,Al that is sold in the shambles eate: asking no question for conscience.

1 Corinthians 10.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,27,"If any inuite you of the infidels, and you wil goe; eate of al that is set before you, asking no question for conscience."
1 Corinthians 10.28 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if any man say, This is immolated to Idols; doe not eate for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience:"
1 Corinthians 10.29 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,29,conscience I say not thine but the other's. For why is my liberite iudged of another man's conscience?
1 Corinthians 10.30 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,30,If I participate with thankes; why am I blasphemed for that which I giue thankes for?
1 Corinthians 10.31 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,31,"Therfore whether you eate, or drinke, or doe any other thing; doe al things vnto the glorie of God."
1 Corinthians 10.32 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,32,"Be without offense to the Iewes & to the Gentils, & to the Church of God:"
1 Corinthians 10.33 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,10,33,"as I also in al things doe please al men, not seeking that which is profitable to my self, but which is to many; that they may be saued."
1 Corinthians 11.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,1,"BE ye followers of me, as I also of Christ."
1 Corinthians 11.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,2,"And I praise you Brethren, that in al things you be mindful of me: and as I haue deliuered vnto you, you keep my precepts."
1 Corinthians 11.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,3,"And I wil haue you know, that the head of euery man, is Christ: and the head of the woman, is the man: and the head of Christ, is God."
1 Corinthians 11.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,4,"Euery man praying or prophecying with his head couered, dishonesteth his head."
1 Corinthians 11.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,5,"But euery woman praying or prophecying with her head not couered, dishonesteth her head: for it is al one as if she were made bald."
1 Corinthians 11.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,6,"For if a woman be not couered, let her be polled. But if it be a foule thing for a woman to be polled or made bold, let her couer her head."
1 Corinthians 11.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,7,"The man truely ought not to couer his head, because he is the image and glorie of God; but the woman is the glorie of the man."
1 Corinthians 11.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,8,"For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man."
1 Corinthians 11.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,9,"For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man."
1 Corinthians 11.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,10,(Therfore ought the woman to haue power vpon her head for the Angels.)
1 Corinthians 11.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,11,"But yet neither the man without the woman; nor the woman without the man, in our Lord."
1 Corinthians 11.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,12,"For as the woman is of the man, so also the man by the woman: but al things of God."
1 Corinthians 11.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,13,Your selues iudge: doth it become a woman not couered to pray vnto God?
1 Corinthians 11.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,14,"Neither doth nature itself teach you, that a man indeed if he nourish his haire, it is an ignominie for him:"
1 Corinthians 11.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,15,"but if a woman nourish her haire, it is a glorie for her, because haire is giuen her for a veile?"
1 Corinthians 11.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,16,"But if any man seeme to be contentious, we haue no such custome, nor the CHVRCH of God."
1 Corinthians 11.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,17,"And this I command: not praising it, that you come together not to better, but to worse."
1 Corinthians 11.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,18,"First indeed when you come together into the Church, I heare that there are schismes among you, and in part I beleeue it."
1 Corinthians 11.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,19,"For there must be heresies also: that they also which are approued, may be made manifest among you."
1 Corinthians 11.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,20,"When you come therfore together in one, it is not now to eate our Lordes supper."
1 Corinthians 11.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,21,"For euery one taketh his owne supper before to eate. And one certes is an hungred, and another is drunke."
1 Corinthians 11.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,22,"Why, haue you not houses to eate and drinke in? or contemne ye the Church of God: and confound them that haue not? What shal I say to you? praise I you in this? I doe not praise you."
1 Corinthians 11.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I receiued of our Lord that which also I haue deliuered vnto you, that our Lord IESVS in the night that he was betraied, tooke bread:"
1 Corinthians 11.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,24,"and giuing thankes brake, and said: Take ye & eate, THIS IS MY BODY WHICH SHAL BE DELIVERED FOR YOV. This doe yet for the commemoration of me."
1 Corinthians 11.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,25,"In like manner also the chalice after he had supped, saying: THIS CHALICE IS THE NEW TESTAMENT IN MY BLOVD. This doe ye, as often as you shal drinke, for the commemoration of me."
1 Corinthians 11.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as you shal eate this bread, and drinke the chalice, you shal shew the death of our Lord, vntil he come."
1 Corinthians 11.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,27,"Therfore whosoeuer shal eate this bread, or drinke the chalice of our Lord vnworthily, he shal be guilty of the body and of the bloud of our Lord."
1 Corinthians 11.28 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,28,"But let a man proue himself: and so, let him eate of that bread, and drinke of the chalice."
1 Corinthians 11.29 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,29,"For he that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh iudgement to himself, not discerning the body of our Lord."
1 Corinthians 11.30 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,30,"Therfore are there among you many weake and feeble, and many sleep."
1 Corinthians 11.31 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,31,"But if we did iudge our selues, we should not be iudged."
1 Corinthians 11.32 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,32,"But whiles we are iudged, of our Lord we are chastised; that with this world we be not damned."
1 Corinthians 11.33 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,33,"Therfore, my Brethren, when you come together to eate, expect one another."
1 Corinthians 11.34 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,11,34,"If any man be an hungred, let him eate at home; that you come not together vnto iudgement. And the rest I wil dispose, when I come."
1 Corinthians 12.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,1,"AND concerning spiritual things, I wil not haue you ignorant, Brethren."
1 Corinthians 12.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,2,"You know that when you were Heathen, you went to dumme Idols according as you were led."
1 Corinthians 12.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,3,"Therfore I doe you to vnderstand that no man speaking in the Spirit of God, saith anathema to IESVS. And no man can say, Our Lord IESVS, but in the Holy Ghost."
1 Corinthians 12.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,4,"And there are diuisions of graces, but one Spirit."
1 Corinthians 12.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,5,And there are diuisions of ministrations; but one Lord.
1 Corinthians 12.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are diuisions of operations, but one God, which worketh al in al."
1 Corinthians 12.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,7,And the manifestation of the Spirit is giuen vnto euery one to profit.
1 Corinthians 12.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,8,"To one certes by the Spirit is giuen the word of wisedom: and to another, the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit:"
1 Corinthians 12.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,9,"to another, faith in the same Spirit: to another, the grace of doing cures in one Spirit:"
1 Corinthians 12.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,10,"to another, the working of miracles: to another, prophecie: to another, discerning of Spirits: to another, kinds of tongues: to another, interpretation of languages."
1 Corinthians 12.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,11,"And al these things worketh one and the same Spirit, diuiding to euery one according as he wil."
1 Corinthians 12.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and al the members of the body whereas they be many, yet are one body; so also Christ."
1 Corinthians 12.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,13,"For in one Spirit, were we al baptized into one, whether Iewes, or Gentils, or bondmen, or free: & in one Spirit we were al made to drinke."
1 Corinthians 12.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,14,"For the body also is not one member, but many."
1 Corinthians 12.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot should say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body: is it therfore not of the body?"
1 Corinthians 12.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the eare should say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body: is he therfore not of the body?"
1 Corinthians 12.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,17,If the whole body were the eye: where is the hearing? If the whole were the hearing: where is the smelling?
1 Corinthians 12.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,18,"But now God hath set the members, euery one of them in the body as he would."
1 Corinthians 12.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,19,"And if al were one member, where were the body?"
1 Corinthians 12.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,20,"But now there are many members indeed, yet one body."
1 Corinthians 12.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,21,And the eye can not say to the hand: I need not thy help; or againe the head to the feet: You are not necessarie for me.
1 Corinthians 12.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,22,"But much more those that seeme to be the more weak members of the body, are more necessarie:"
1 Corinthians 12.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,23,"and such as we thinke to be the baser members of the body, vpon them we put more aboundant honour: and those that are our vnhonest parts, haue more aboundant honestie."
1 Corinthians 12.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,24,"And our honest parts need nothing: but God hath tempered the body, giuing to it that wanted, the more aboundant honour,"
1 Corinthians 12.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,25,"that there might be no schisme in the body, but the members together might be careful one for another."
1 Corinthians 12.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,26,"And if one member suffer any thing, al the members suffer with it. Or if one member doe glorie, al the members reioyce with it."
1 Corinthians 12.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,27,"And you are the body of Christ, and members of member."
1 Corinthians 12.28 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,28,"And some verily God hath set in the Church first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly Doctours, next miracles, then the graces of doing cures, helps, gouernements, kinds of tongues."
1 Corinthians 12.29 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,29,Are al Apostles? are al Prophets? are al Doctours?
1 Corinthians 12.30 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,30,are al miracles? haue al the grace of doing cures? doe al speake with tongues? doe al interpret?
1 Corinthians 12.31 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,12,31,But pursue the better guifts. And yet I shew you a more excellent way.
1 Corinthians 13.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,1,"IF I speake with the tongues of men, and of Angels, and haue not charitie, I am become as sounding brasse, or a tinkling cymbal."
1 Corinthians 13.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,2,"And if I should haue prophecie, and knew al mysteries, and al knowledge, & if I should haue al faith so that I could remoue mountaines, and haue not charitie, I am nothing."
1 Corinthians 13.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,3,"And if I should distribute al my goods to be meate for the poore, and if I should deliuer my body so that I burne, and haue not charitie, it doth profit me nothing."
1 Corinthians 13.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,4,"Charitie is patient, is benigne: Charitie enuieth not, dealeth not peruersly: is not puffed vp,"
1 Corinthians 13.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,5,"is not ambitious, seeketh not her owne, is not prouoked to anger, thinketh not euil,"
1 Corinthians 13.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,6,"reioyceth not vpon iniquitie, but reioyceth with the truth:"
1 Corinthians 13.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,7,"suffereth al things, beleeueth al things, hopeth al things, beareth al things."
1 Corinthians 13.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,8,"Charitie neuer falleth away: whether prophecies shal be made void, or tongues shal cease, or knowledge shal be destroied."
1 Corinthians 13.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,9,"For in part we know, & in part we prophecie."
1 Corinthians 13.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,10,"But when that shal come that is perfect, that shal be made void that is in part."
1 Corinthians 13.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a litle one, I speake as a litle one, I vnderstood as a litle one, I thought as a litle one. But when I was made a man, I did away the things that belonged to a litle one."
1 Corinthians 13.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,12,We see now by a glasse in a darke fort: but then face to face. Now I know in part: but then I shal know as also I am knowen.
1 Corinthians 13.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,13,13,"And now there remaine, faith, hope, charitie, these three: but the greater of these is charitie."
1 Corinthians 14.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,1,"FOLLOW Charitie, earnestly pursue spiritual things: but rather that you may prophecy."
1 Corinthians 14.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he that speaketh with tongues speaketh not to men, but to God: for no man heareth. But in spirit he speaketh mysteries."
1 Corinthians 14.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,3,"For he that propecieth, speaketh to men vnto edification, & exhortation, & consolation."
1 Corinthians 14.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,4,"He that speaketh with tongues, edifieth himself; but he that prophecieth, edifieth the Church."
1 Corinthians 14.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,5,"And I would haue you al to speake with tongues, but rather to prophecy. For greater is he that prophecieth, then he that speaketh with tongues: vnlesse perhaps he interpret, that the Church may take edification."
1 Corinthians 14.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,6,"But now, Brethren; if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shal I profit you, vnlesse I speake to you either in reuelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecie, or in doctrine?"
1 Corinthians 14.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,7,"Yet the things without life that giue a sound, be it pipe of harpe, vnlesse they giue a distinction of sounds, how shal that be knowen which is piped, or which is harped?"
1 Corinthians 14.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,8,"For if the trumpet giue an vncertaine voice, who shal prepare himself to battel?"
1 Corinthians 14.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,9,"So you also by a tongue vnlesse you vtter manifest speach, how shal that be knowen that is said? for you shal be speaking into the aire."
1 Corinthians 14.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are (for example) so many kinds of tongues in this world, & none is without voice."
1 Corinthians 14.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,11,"If then I know not the vertue of the voice, I shal be to him to whom I speake, barbarous; and he that speaketh barbarous to me."
1 Corinthians 14.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,12,"So you also, because you be emulatours of spirits: seek to abound vnto the edifying of the Church."
1 Corinthians 14.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,13,"And therfore he that speaketh with the tongue, let him pray that he may interpret."
1 Corinthians 14.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray with the tongue, my spirit praieth, but my vnderstanding is without fruit."
1 Corinthians 14.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is it then? I wil pray in the spirit, I wil pray also in the vnderstanding: I wil sing in the spirit, I wil sing also in the vnderstanding."
1 Corinthians 14.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,16,"But if thou blesse in the spirit, he that supplieth the place of the vulgar how shal he say, Amen, vpon thy blessing? because he knoweth not what thou saiest."
1 Corinthians 14.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,17,"For thou indeed giuest thankes wel, but the other is not edified."
1 Corinthians 14.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,18,"I giue my God thankes, that I speake with the tongue of you al."
1 Corinthians 14.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,19,But in the Church I wil speake fiue words with my vnderstanding that I may instruct others also; rather then ten thousand words in a tongue.
1 Corinthians 14.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, be not made children in sense, but in malice be children, and in sense be perfect."
1 Corinthians 14.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the Law it is written: That in other tongues and other lippes I wil speake to this people: and neither so wil they heare me, saith our Lord."
1 Corinthians 14.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,22,"Therfore languages are for a signe not to the faithful, but to infidels: but prophecies, not to infidels, but to the faithful."
1 Corinthians 14.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,23,"If therfore the whole Church come together in one, and al speake with tongues, and there enter in vulgar persons or infidels, wil they not say that you be mad?"
1 Corinthians 14.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if al prophecie, and there enter in any infidel or vulgar person, he is conuinced of al, he is iudged of al."
1 Corinthians 14.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,25,"the secrets of his hart are made manifest, and so falling on his face he wil adore God, pronouncing that God is in you indeed."
1 Corinthians 14.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,26,"What is it then, Brethren? when you come together, euery one of you hath a psalme, hath a doctrine, hath a reuelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let al things be done to edification."
1 Corinthians 14.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,27,"Whether a man speake with tongue, by two, or at the most by three, and in course, and let one interpret."
1 Corinthians 14.28 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if there be not an interpreter, let him hold his peace in the Church, and speake to himself and to God."
1 Corinthians 14.29 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,29,"And let Prophets speake two or three, and let the rest iudge."
1 Corinthians 14.30 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,30,"But if it be reuealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace."
1 Corinthians 14.31 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,31,"For you may al prophecie one by one: that al may learne, and al may be exhorted:"
1 Corinthians 14.32 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,32,and the spirits of prophets are subiect to prophets.
1 Corinthians 14.33 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,33,"For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also in al the Churches of the Saints I teach."
1 Corinthians 14.34 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,34,"Let women hold their peace in the Churches: for it is not permitted them to speake, but to be subiect, as also the Law saith."
1 Corinthians 14.35 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,35,"But if they learne any thing, let them aske their owne husbands at home. For it is a foule thing for a woman to speake in the Church."
1 Corinthians 14.36 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,36,Or did the word of God proceed from you? came it vnto you only?
1 Corinthians 14.37 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,37,"If any man seeme to be a Prophet, or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandements of our Lord."
1 Corinthians 14.38 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if any man know not, he shal not be knowen."
1 Corinthians 14.39 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,39,"Therfore, Brethren, be earnest to prophecie: and to speake with tongues prohibit not."
1 Corinthians 14.40 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,14,40,But let al things be done honestly and according to order among you.
1 Corinthians 15.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,1,"AND I doe you to vnderstand, Brethren, the Ghospel which I preached to you, which also you receiued, in the which also you stand,"
1 Corinthians 15.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,2,"by the which also you are saued, after what manner I preached vnto you if you keep it, vnlesse you haue beleeued in vaine."
1 Corinthians 15.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,3,For I deliuered vnto you first of al which I also receiued: that Christ died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures:
1 Corinthians 15.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,4,"and that he was buried, and that he rose againe the third day, according to the Scriptures:"
1 Corinthians 15.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,5,and that he was seen of Cephas; and after that of the eleuen.
1 Corinthians 15.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,6,"Then was he seen of moe then fiue hundred Brethren together: of which many remaine vntil this present, and some are a-sleep."
1 Corinthians 15.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,7,"Moreouer he was seen of Iames, then of al the Apostles."
1 Corinthians 15.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,8,"And last of al, as it were of an abortiue he was seen also of me."
1 Corinthians 15.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the Apostles, who am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God."
1 Corinthians 15.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am that which I am; & his grace in me hath not been void, but I haue laboured more aboundantly then al they: yet not I, but the grace of God with me."
1 Corinthians 15.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,11,"For whether I, or they, so we preach, and so you haue beleeued."
1 Corinthians 15.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,12,"But if Christ be preached that he is risen againe from the dead, how doe certaine among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
1 Corinthians 15.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,13,"And if there be no resurrection of the dead, neither is Christ risen againe."
1 Corinthians 15.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,14,"And if Christ be not risen againe, then vaine is our preaching, vaine also is your faith."
1 Corinthians 15.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,15,"And we are found also false witnesses of God: because we haue giuen testimonie against God, that he hath raised vp Christ, whom he hath not raised vp, if the dead rise not againe."
1 Corinthians 15.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead rise not againe, neither is Christ risen againe."
1 Corinthians 15.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,17,"And if Christ be not risen againe, vaine is your faith, for yet you are in your sinnes."
1 Corinthians 15.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,18,"Then they also that are a-sleep in Christ, are perished."
1 Corinthians 15.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,19,"If in this life onely we be hoping in Christ, we are more miserable then al men."
1 Corinthians 15.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,20,"But now Christ is risen againe from the dead, the first fruits of them that sleep:"
1 Corinthians 15.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,21,by a man death; and by a man the resurrection of the dead.
1 Corinthians 15.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,22,"And as in Adam al die, so also in Christ al shal be made aliue."
1 Corinthians 15.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,23,"But euery one in his owne order: the first fruits Christ, then they that are of Christ, that beleeued in his comming."
1 Corinthians 15.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then the end, when he shal haue deliuered the Kingdom to God and the Father, when he shal haue abolished al principalitie & authoritie & power."
1 Corinthians 15.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,25,"And he must reigne, Vntil he put al his enemies vnder his feet."
1 Corinthians 15.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,26,"And the enemie death shal be destroied last. For he hath subdued al things vnder his feet. And whereas he saith,"
1 Corinthians 15.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,27,"Al things are subdued to him; vndoubtedly, except him that subdued al things vnto him."
1 Corinthians 15.28 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,28,"And when al things shal be subdued to him; then the Sonne also himself shal be subiect to him that subdued al things vnto him, that God may be al in al."
1 Corinthians 15.29 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,29,"Otherwise what shal they doe that are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not againe at al?"
1 Corinthians 15.30 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,30,Why also are they baptized for them? Why also are we in danger euery houre?
1 Corinthians 15.31 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,31,"I die daily by your glorie, Brethren, which I haue in Christ IESVS our Lord."
1 Corinthians 15.32 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,32,"If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not againe? Let vs eate and drinke, for to morow we shal die."

1 Corinthians 15.34 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,34,"Awake ye iust, and sinne not. For some haue not the knowledge of God, I speake to your shame."
1 Corinthians 15.35 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,35,But some man saith: How doe the dead rise againe? and with what manner of body shal they come?
1 Corinthians 15.36 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,36,"Foole, that which thou sowest is not quickned, vnlesse it die first."
1 Corinthians 15.37 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,37,"And the which thou sowest, not the body that shal be, doest thou sow; but bare graine, to wit, of wheat, or of some of the rest."
1 Corinthians 15.38 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,38,And God giueth it a body as he wil: & to euery seed his proper body.
1 Corinthians 15.39 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,39,"Not al flesh, is the same flesh: but one of men, another of beasts, another of birdes, another of fishes."
1 Corinthians 15.40 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,40,"And bodies celestial, & bodies terrestrial: but, one glorie of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial."
1 Corinthians 15.41 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,41,"One glorie of the sunne, another glorie of the moone, and another glorie of the starres. For starre differeth from starre in glorie:"
1 Corinthians 15.42 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,42,"so also the resurrection of the dead. It is sowen in corruption, it shal rise in incorruption."
1 Corinthians 15.43 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,43,"It is sowen in dishonour, it shal rise in glorie. It is sowen in infirmitie, it shal rise in power."
1 Corinthians 15.44 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,44,"It is sowen a natural body; it shal rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual,"
1 Corinthians 15.45 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,45,as it is written: The first man Adam was made into a liuing soul: the last Adam into a quickning spirit.
1 Corinthians 15.46 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,46,"Yet that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural: afterward that which is spiritual."
1 Corinthians 15.47 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,47,"The first man of earth, earthly: the second man from Heauen, heauenly."
1 Corinthians 15.48 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,48,"Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthy: and such as the heauenly, such also are the heauenly."
1 Corinthians 15.49 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,49,"Therfore as we haue borne the image of the earthly, let vs beare also the image of the heauenly."
1 Corinthians 15.50 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,50,"This I say, Brethren, that flesh and bloud can not possesse the Kingdom of God: neither shal corruption possesse incorruption."
1 Corinthians 15.51 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,51,Behold I tel you a mysterie. We shal al indeed rise againe: but we shal not al be changed.
1 Corinthians 15.52 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,52,"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trompet (for the trompet shal sound) and the dead shal rise againe incorruptible: and we shal be changed."
1 Corinthians 15.53 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,53,For this corruptible must doe-on incorruption; & this mortal doe-on immortalitie.
1 Corinthians 15.54 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,54,"And when this mortal hath done-on immortalitie, then shal come to passe the saying that is written: Death is swallowed vp in victorie."
1 Corinthians 15.55 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,55,Death where is thy victorie? Death where is thy sting?
1 Corinthians 15.56 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,56,"And the sting of death, is sinne: and the power of sinne is the Law."
1 Corinthians 15.57 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,57,But thankes be to God that hath giuen vs the victorie by our Lord IESVS Christ.
1 Corinthians 15.58 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,15,58,"Therfore, my beloued Brethren be stable and vnmoueable; abounding in the worke of our Lord alwaies, knowing that your labour is not vaine in our Lord."
1 Corinthians 16.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,1,"AND concerning the collections that are made for the Saints, as I haue ordeined to the Churches of Galatia, so doe ye also."
1 Corinthians 16.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,2,"In the first of the Sabboth let euery one of you put a part with himself, laying vp what shal wel like him: that not when I come, then collections be made."
1 Corinthians 16.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,3,"And when I shal be present; whom you shal approue by letters, them wil I send to carie your grace into Hierusalem."

1 Corinthians 16.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,7,"For I wil not now see you by the way, for I hope that I shal abide with you sometime, if our Lord wil permit."
1 Corinthians 16.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,8,But I wil tarie at Ephesus vntil Pentecost.

1 Corinthians 16.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,12,"And of Brother Apollo I doe you to vnderstand, that I much intreated him to come vnto you with the Brethren: and at al it was not his mind to come now. But he wil come when he shal haue leisure."
1 Corinthians 16.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,13,"Watch ye, stand in the faith, doe manfully, & be strengthned."
1 Corinthians 16.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,14,Let al your things be done in charitie.
1 Corinthians 16.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,15,"And I beseech you, Brethren, you know the house of Stephanas, and of Fortunatus, that they are the first fruits of Achaia, & haue ordeined themselues to the ministerie of the Saints:"

1 Corinthians 16.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,18,For they haue refreshed both my spirit and yours. Know them therfore that are such.
1 Corinthians 16.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,19,The Churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla with their domestical Church salute you much in our Lord.
1 Corinthians 16.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,20,Al the Brethren salute you. Salute one another in a holy kisse.
1 Corinthians 16.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,21,The salutation with mine owne hand Paules.
1 Corinthians 16.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,1 Corinthians,16,22,"If any man loue not our Lord IESVS Christ, be he anathema Maranatha."

2 Corinthians 1.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,5,For as the passions of Christ abound in vs: so also by Christ doth our comfort abound.
2 Corinthians 1.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,6,"And whether we be in tribulation, for your exhortation & salutation: whether we be exhorted, for your exhortation & saluation, which worketh the toleration of the same passions which we also doe suffer:"
2 Corinthians 1.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,7,"and our hope is firme for you: knowing that as you are partakers of the passions, so shal you be of the consolation also."

2 Corinthians 1.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,9,"But we in our selues, had the answer of death, that we be not trusting in our selues, but in God who raiseth vp the dead,"
2 Corinthians 1.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,10,"who hath deliuered and doth deliuer vs out of so great dangers: in whom we hope that he wil yet also deliuer vs,"

2 Corinthians 1.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,12,"For our glorie is this, the testimonie of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisedom, but in the grace of God we haue conuersed in this world: and more aboundantly towards you."
2 Corinthians 1.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,13,For we write no other things to you then that you haue read and know. And I hope that you shal know vnto the end:
2 Corinthians 1.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,14,"as also you haue knowen vs in part, that we are your glorie, as you also ours in the day of our Lord IESVS Christ."
2 Corinthians 1.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,15,"And in this confidence I would first haue come to you, that you might haue a second grace:"

2 Corinthians 1.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,22,"who also hath sealed vs, and giuen the pledge of the Spirit in our harts."
2 Corinthians 1.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,23,"And I cal God to witnesse vpon my soul, that sparing you, I came not any more to Corinth,"
2 Corinthians 1.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,1,24,"not because we ouer-rule your faith: but, we are helpers of your ioy. For in the faith you stand."
2 Corinthians 2.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,1,"AND I haue determined with my-self this same thing, not to come to you againe in sorrow."
2 Corinthians 2.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,2,"For if I make you sorie; & who is it that can make me glad, but he that is made sorie by me?"
2 Corinthians 2.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,3,"And this same I wrote to you; that I may not, when I come, haue sorrow vpon sorrow, of the which I ought to reioyce: trusting in you al, that my ioy is the ioy of you al."
2 Corinthians 2.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,4,For of much tribulation and anguish of hart I wrote to you by many teares: not that you should be made sorie; but that you may know what charitie I haue more aboundantly toward you.
2 Corinthians 2.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,5,"And if any man hath made sorrowful, not me hath he made sorrowful, but in part, that I burden not al you."
2 Corinthians 2.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,6,To him that is such a one this rebuke sufficeth that is giuen of many:
2 Corinthians 2.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,7,"so that contrariewise you should rather pardon and comfort him, lest perhaps such an one be swallowed vp with ouer great sorrow."
2 Corinthians 2.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,8,For the which cause I beseech you that you confirme charitie toward him.
2 Corinthians 2.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,9,"For therfore also haue I written that I may know the experiment of you, whether in al things you be obedient."
2 Corinthians 2.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,10,"And whom you haue pardoned any thing, I also. For, my-self also that which I pardoned, if I pardoned any thing, for you in the person of Christ,"
2 Corinthians 2.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,11,that we be not circumuented of Satan. For we are not ignorant of his cogitations.
2 Corinthians 2.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,12,"And when I was come to Troas for the Ghospel of Christ, and a doore was opened vnto me in our Lord,"
2 Corinthians 2.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit, for that I found not Titus my Brother, but bidding them fare wel, I went forth into Macedonia."
2 Corinthians 2.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,14,"And thankes be to God, who alwaies triumpheth vs in Christ IESVS, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by vs in euery place."
2 Corinthians 2.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,15,"For we are the good odour of Christ vnto God in them that are saued, & in them that perish."
2 Corinthians 2.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,16,To some indeed the odour of death vnto death: but to others the odour of life vnto life. And to these things who is so sufficient?
2 Corinthians 2.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,2,17,"For we are not as very many adulterating the word of God, but of sinceritie, and as of God, before God, in Christ we speak."
2 Corinthians 3.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,1,"BEGIN we againe to commend our-selues? or doe we need (as certaine) epistles of commendation to you, or from you?"
2 Corinthians 3.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,2,"Our epistle you are, written in our harts, which is knowen & read of al men:"
2 Corinthians 3.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,3,"being manifested that you are the epistle of Christ, ministred by vs, & written not with inke, but with the Spirit of the liuing God: not in tables of stone, but in the tables carnal of the hart."
2 Corinthians 3.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,4,And such confidence we haue by Christ to God:
2 Corinthians 3.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,5,"not that we be sufficient to thinke any thing of our-selues, as of our-selues: but our sufficiencie is of God."
2 Corinthians 3.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,6,"Who also hath made vs meet Ministers of the new Testament not in the letter, but in the Spirit. For the letter killeth: but the Spirit quickneth."
2 Corinthians 3.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,7,"And if the ministration of death with letters figured in stones, was in glorie, so that the children of Israel could not behold the face of Moyses for the glorie of his countenance, that is made void;"
2 Corinthians 3.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,8,how shal not the ministration of the Spirit be more in glorie?
2 Corinthians 3.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,9,"For if the ministration of damnation be in glorie, much more the ministerie of iustice aboundeth in glorie."
2 Corinthians 3.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,10,"For neither was it glorified, which in this part was glorious, by reason of the excelling glorie."
2 Corinthians 3.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,11,"For is that which is made void, is by glorie: much more that which abideth, is in glorie."
2 Corinthians 3.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,12,"Hauing therfore such hope, we vse much confidence:"
2 Corinthians 3.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,13,"and not as Moyses put a veile vpon his face, that the children of Israel might not behold his face, which is made void."
2 Corinthians 3.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,14,"but their senses were dulled. For vntil this present day, the self-same veile in the lecture of the old Testament remaineth vnreuealed (because in Christ it is made void)"
2 Corinthians 3.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,15,"but vntil this present day, when Moyses is read, a veile is put vpon their hart."
2 Corinthians 3.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,16,"But when he shal be conuerted to our Lord, the veile shal be taken away."
2 Corinthians 3.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,17,"And our Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of our Lord is, there is libertie."
2 Corinthians 3.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,3,18,"But we al, beholding the glorie of our Lord with face reuealed, are transformed into the same image from glorie vnto glorie, as of our Lordes Spirit."
2 Corinthians 4.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,1,"THERFORE hauing this ministration; according as we haue obteined mercie, we faile not,"
2 Corinthians 4.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,2,"but we renounce the secret things of dishonestie, not walking in craftines, nor adulterating the word of God, but in manifestation of the truth commending our-selues to euery conscience of men before God."
2 Corinthians 4.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,3,"And if our Ghospel be also hid, in them that perish it is hid,"
2 Corinthians 4.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,4,"in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of the infidels, that the illumination of the Ghospel of the glorie of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine to them."
2 Corinthians 4.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,5,"For we preach not our-selues, but IESVS Christ our Lord: and vs, your seruants by IESVS:"
2 Corinthians 4.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,6,"because God that commanded light to shine of darkenes, he hath shined in our harts to the illumination of the knowledge of the glorie of God, in the face of Christ IESVS."
2 Corinthians 4.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,7,"But we haue this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellencie may be of the power of God, and not of vs."
2 Corinthians 4.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,8,"In al things we suffer tribulation, but are not in distresse: we want, but are not destitute:"
2 Corinthians 4.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,9,"we suffer persecution, but are not forsaken: we are cast downe, but we perish not:"
2 Corinthians 4.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,10,"alwaies bearing about in our body the mortification of IESVS, that the life also of IESVS may be manifested in our bodies."
2 Corinthians 4.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,11,For we that liue are alwaies deliuered vnto death for IESVS: that the life also of IESVS may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
2 Corinthians 4.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,12,"Death then worketh in vs, but life in you."
2 Corinthians 4.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,13,"And hauing the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I beleeued, for the which cause I haue spoken, we also beleeue, for the which cause we speake also:"
2 Corinthians 4.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,14,"knowing that he which raised vp IESVS, wil raise vp vs also with IESVS and set vs with you."
2 Corinthians 4.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,15,"For al things are for you: that the grace abounding by many in giuing of thanks, may abound vnto the glorie of God."
2 Corinthians 4.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,16,"For which cause we faile not: but although that our man which is without, corrupt: yet that which is within, is renewed from day to day."
2 Corinthians 4.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,17,"For that our tribulation which presently is momentanie & light, worketh aboue measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glorie in vs,"
2 Corinthians 4.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,4,18,"we not considering the things that are seen, but that are not seen. For the things that be seen, are temporal: but those that be not seen, are eternal."
2 Corinthians 5.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,1,"FOR we know that if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolued, that we haue a building of God, a house not made with hand, eternal in Heauen."
2 Corinthians 5.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,2,"For in this also doe we grone, desirous to be ouer-clothed with our habitation that is from Heauen:"
2 Corinthians 5.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,3,"yet so, if we be found clothed, not naked."
2 Corinthians 5.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,4,"For we also that are in this tabernacle, grone being burdned: because we would not be spoiled, but ouer-clothed, that that which is mortal might be swallowed vp of life."
2 Corinthians 5.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,5,"And he that maketh vs to this same, is God, who hath giuen vs the pledge of the Spirit."
2 Corinthians 5.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,6,"Being bold therfore alwaies, and knowing that while we are in the body, we are pilgrimes from God,"
2 Corinthians 5.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,7,(for we walke by faith and not by sight)
2 Corinthians 5.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,8,"but we are bold, and haue a good wil to be pilgrimes rather from the body, & to be present with our Lord."
2 Corinthians 5.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,9,"And therfore we endeauour, whether absent or present, to please him."
2 Corinthians 5.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,10,"For we must al be manifested before the iudgement seat of Christ, that euery one may receiue the proper things of the body, according as he hath done either good or euil."
2 Corinthians 5.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,11,Knowing thefore the feare of our Lord we vse persuasion to men: but to God we are manifest.
2 Corinthians 5.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,12,And I hope also that in your consciences we are manifest.
2 Corinthians 5.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,13,"We commend not our selues againe to you, but giue you occasion to glorie for vs: that you may haue against them that glorie in face, and not in hart."
2 Corinthians 5.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,14,"For whether we exceed in mind, to God: or whether we be sober, to you."
2 Corinthians 5.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,15,"For the charitie of Christ vrgeth vs; iudging this, that if one died for al, then al were dead."
2 Corinthians 5.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,16,"And Christ died for al: that they also which liue, may not now liue to themselues, but to him that died for them and rose againe."
2 Corinthians 5.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,17,Therfore we from hence-forth know no man according to the flesh. And if we haue knowen Christ according to the flesh: but now we know him no more.
2 Corinthians 5.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,18,"If then any be in Christ a new creature: the old are passed, behold al things are made new."
2 Corinthians 5.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,19,"But al of God, who hath reconciled vs to himself by Christ: and hath giuen vs the ministerie of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians 5.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,20,"For God indeed was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sinnes, and hath put in vs the word of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians 5.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,21,"For Christ therfore we are Legates, God as it were exhorting by vs. For Christ we beseech you, be reconciled to God."
2 Corinthians 5.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,5,22,"Him that knew no sinne, for vs he made sinne: that we might be made the iustice of God in him."
2 Corinthians 6.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,1,"AND we helping doe exhort, that you receiue not the grace of God in vaine."
2 Corinthians 6.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,2,"(For he saith: In time accepted haue I heard thee; and in the day of saluation haue I holpen thee. Behold, now is the time acceptable: behold now the day of saluation.)"
2 Corinthians 6.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,3,"to no man giuing any offence, that our ministerie be not blamed:"
2 Corinthians 6.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,4,"but in al things let vs exhibit our selues as the Ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses,"
2 Corinthians 6.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,5,"in stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,"
2 Corinthians 6.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,6,"in chastitie, in knowledge, in longanimitie, in sweetnes, in the Holy Ghost, in charitie not feined,"
2 Corinthians 6.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,7,"in the word of truth, in the vertue of God; by the armour of iustice on the right hand and on the left,"
2 Corinthians 6.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,8,"by honour and dishonour, by infamie and good fame: as seducers, and true: as they that are unknowen, and knowen:"
2 Corinthians 6.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,9,"as dying, and behold we liue: as chastened, & not killed:"
2 Corinthians 6.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,10,"as sorrowful, but alwaies reioycing: as needie, but enriching many: as hauing nothing, and possessing al things."
2 Corinthians 6.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,11,"Our mouth is open to you, o Corinthians, our hart is dilated."
2 Corinthians 6.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,12,You are not straitned in vs: but in your owne bowels you are straitned.
2 Corinthians 6.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,13,But hauing the same reward (I speake as to my children) be you also dilated.
2 Corinthians 6.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,14,Beare not the yoke with infidels. For what participation hath iustice with iniquitie? or what societie is there between light and darkenes?
2 Corinthians 6.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,15,And what agreement with Christ and Belial? or what part hath the faithful with the infidel?
2 Corinthians 6.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,16,"And what agreement hath the Temple of God with the Idols? For you are the Temple of the liuing God: as God saith, That I wil dwel, and walke in them, and wil be their God; and they shal be my people."
2 Corinthians 6.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,17,"For the which cause, Goe out of the middes of them, and separate your selues, saith our Lord, and touch not the vncleane: and I wil receiue you."
2 Corinthians 6.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,6,18,"and I wil be a Father to you: and you shal be my sonnes & daughters, saith our Lord omnipotent."
2 Corinthians 7.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,1,"HAVING therfore these promises, my Dearest, let vs cleanse our selues from al inquination of the flesh and spirit, perfiting sanctification in the feare of God."
2 Corinthians 7.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,2,"Receiue vs. We haue hurt no man, we haue corrupted no man, we haue circumuented no man."
2 Corinthians 7.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,3,I speake not to your condemnation. For I said before that you are in our harts to die together and to liue together.
2 Corinthians 7.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,4,"Much is my confidence with you, much is my glorying for you. I am replenished with consolation; I doe exceedingly abound in ioy in al our tribulation."
2 Corinthians 7.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,5,"For also when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we suffered al tribulation: without, combats; within, feares."
2 Corinthians 7.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,6,"But God that comforteth the humble, did comfort vs, in the comming of Titus."
2 Corinthians 7.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,7,"And not only in his comming, but also in the consolation, wherwith he was comforted among you, reporting to vs your desire, your weeping, your emulation for me, so that I reioyced the more."
2 Corinthians 7.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,8,"For although I made you sorie in an epistle, it repenteth me not: albeit it repented me, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorie."
2 Corinthians 7.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,9,"Now I am glad: not because you were made sorie, but because you were made sorie to penance. For you were made sorie according to God, that in nothing you should suffer detriment by vs."
2 Corinthians 7.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,10,"For the sorrow that is according to God, worketh penance vnto saluation that is stable: but the sorrow of the world worketh death."
2 Corinthians 7.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,11,"For behold this very thing, that you were made sorie according to God, how great carefulnes it worketh in you: yea defense, yea indignation, yea feare, yea desire, yea emulation, yea reuenge, in al things you haue shewed your selues to be vndefiled in the matter."
2 Corinthians 7.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,12,"Therfore although I wrote to you, not for him that did the iniurie, nor for him that suffered: but to manifest our carefulnes that we haue for you before God,"
2 Corinthians 7.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,13,"therfore we are comforted. But in our consolation, we did the more aboundantly reioyce vpon the ioy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed of al you."
2 Corinthians 7.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,14,"And if to him I gloried any thing of you, I am not confounded: but as we speake al things to you in truth, so also our glorying that was to Titus, is made a truth,"
2 Corinthians 7.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,15,"and his bowels are more aboundantly toward you: remembring the obedience of you al, how with feare and trembling you receiued him."
2 Corinthians 7.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,7,16,I reioyce that in al things I haue confidence in you.
2 Corinthians 8.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,1,"AND we doe you to vnderstand, Brethren, the grace of God, that is giuen in the Churches of Macedonia,"
2 Corinthians 8.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,2,"that in much experience of tribulation they had aboundance of ioy, & their very deep pouertie abounded vnto the riches of their simplicitie,"
2 Corinthians 8.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,3,"for according to their power (I giue them testimonie) and aboue their power they were willing,"
2 Corinthians 8.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,4,with much exhortation requesting vs the grace and communication of the ministerie that is done toward the Saints.
2 Corinthians 8.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,5,"And not as we hoped, but their owne selues they gaue, first to our Lord, then to vs by the wil of God:"
2 Corinthians 8.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,6,"in so much that we desired Titus, that as he began, so also he would perfit in you this grace also."
2 Corinthians 8.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,7,"But as in al things you abound in faith, and word, & knowledge, & al carefulnes, moreouer also in your charitie towards vs, that in this grace also you may abound."
2 Corinthians 8.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,8,"I speake not as commanding: but by the carefulnes of others, approuing also the good disposition of your charitie."
2 Corinthians 8.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord IESVS Christ, that for you he was made poore, wheras he was rich; that by his pouertie you might be rich."
2 Corinthians 8.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,10,"And in this point I giue counsel: for this is profitable for you, which haue begun not only to doe, but also to be willing, from the yeare past:"
2 Corinthians 8.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,11,"But not performe ye it also in deed: that as your mind is prompt to be willing, so it may be also to performe, of that which you haue."
2 Corinthians 8.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,12,"For if the wil be prompt, it is accepted according to that which it hath, not according to that which it hath not."
2 Corinthians 8.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,13,"For not that other should haue ease, and you tribulation: but by an equalitie."
2 Corinthians 8.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,14,"Let in this present time your aboundance supplie their want: that their aboundance also may supplie your want, that there be an equalitie"
2 Corinthians 8.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,15,"as it is written: He that had much abounded not: and he that had litle, wanted not."
2 Corinthians 8.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,16,"And thankes be to God, that hath giuen the self-same carefulnes for you in the hart of Titus,"
2 Corinthians 8.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,17,"for that he admitted indeed exhortation: but being more careful, of his owne wil he went vnto you."
2 Corinthians 8.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,18,"We haue sent also with him the Brother, whose praise is in the Ghospel through al Churches:"
2 Corinthians 8.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,19,"& not only that, but also he was ordeined of the churches fellow of our peregrination, for this grace which is ministred of vs to the glorie of our Lord, and our determined wil:"
2 Corinthians 8.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,20,"auoiding this, lest any man might reprehend vs in this fulnes that is ministred of vs."
2 Corinthians 8.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,21,"For we prouide good things not only before God, but also before men."
2 Corinthians 8.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,22,"And we haue sent with them our Brother also, whom we haue proued in many things often to be careful: but now much more careful, for the great confidence in you,"
2 Corinthians 8.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,23,"either for Titus which is my fellow and Coadiutor toward you, or our Brethren Apostles of the Churches, the glorie of Christ."
2 Corinthians 8.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,8,24,"The declaration therfore which is of your charitie and our glorying for you, declare ye toward them in the face of the churches."
2 Corinthians 9.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,1,"FOR concerning the ministerie that is done toward the Saints, it is superfluous for me to write vnto you."
2 Corinthians 9.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,2,"For I know your prompt mind: for the which I glorie of you to the Macedonians: That Achaia also is ready from the yeare past, and your emulation hath prouoked very many."
2 Corinthians 9.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,3,"But I haue sent the Brethren, that the thing which we glorie of you, be not made void in this behalfe, that (as I haue said) you may be ready:"
2 Corinthians 9.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,4,"lest when the Macedonians shal come with me, and find you vnready, we (that we say not, ye) may be ashamed in this substance."
2 Corinthians 9.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,5,"Therfore I thought it necessarie to desire the Brethren that they would come to you, and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready so, as a blessing, not as auarice."
2 Corinthians 9.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,6,"And this I say, he that soweth sparingly, sparingly also shal reap: and he that soweth in blessings, of blessings also shal reap."
2 Corinthians 9.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,7,"Euery one as he hath determined in his hart, not of sadnes or of necessitie."
2 Corinthians 9.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,8,For God loueth a cheerful giuer.
2 Corinthians 9.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,9,"And God is able to make al grace abound in you: that in al things alwaies hauing al sufficiencie, you may abound vnto al good workes,"
2 Corinthians 9.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,10,"as it is written: He distributed, he gaue to the poore: his iustice remaineth for euer."
2 Corinthians 9.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,11,"And he that ministreth seed to the sower, wil giue bread also for to eate: and wil mulitplie your seed and wil augment the increases of the fruits of your iustice:"
2 Corinthians 9.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,12,"that being enriched in al things, you may abound vnto al simplicitie, which worketh by vs thankes-giuing to God."
2 Corinthians 9.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,13,"Because the ministerie of this office doth not only supplie those things that the Saints want, but aboundeth also by many thankes-giuings in our Lord,"
2 Corinthians 9.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,14,"by the proofe of this ministerie, glorifying God in the obedience of your confession vnto the Ghospel of Christ, and in the simplicitie of communicating vnto them, and vnto al,"
2 Corinthians 9.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,15,"and in their praying for you, being desirous of you because of the excellent grace of God in you."
2 Corinthians 9.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,9,16,Thankes be to God for his vnspeakeable guift.
2 Corinthians 10.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,1,"AND I Paul my self beseech you be the mildenes and modestie of Christ, who in presence indeed am humble among you, but absent am bold on you."
2 Corinthians 10.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,2,"But I beseech you, that being present I need not be bold by that confidence wherwith I am thought to be bold against some: which thinke vs as though we walke according to the flesh."
2 Corinthians 10.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,3,"For walking in the flesh, we warre not according to the flesh."
2 Corinthians 10.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,4,"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal: but mightie to God vnto the destruction of munitions, destroying counsels,"
2 Corinthians 10.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,5,"and al lofitnesse extolling itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captiuitie al vnderstanding vnto the obedience of Christ,"
2 Corinthians 10.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,6,"and hauing in a readinesse to reuenge al disobedience, when your obedience shal be fulfilled."
2 Corinthians 10.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,7,"See the things that are according to appearance. If any man haue affiance in himself, that he is Christ's: let him thinke this againe with himself, that as he is Christ's, so we also."
2 Corinthians 10.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,8,"For and if I should glorie some-what more of our power, which our Lord hath giuen vs vnto edification and not to your destruction; I shal not be ashamed."
2 Corinthians 10.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,9,But that I may not be thought as it were to terrifie you by epistles
2 Corinthians 10.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,10,"(for his epistles indeed, say they, are sore and vehement; but his bodily presence weake, & his speach contemptible)"
2 Corinthians 10.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,11,"let him this thinke that is such a one, that as we are in word by epistles, absent; such also we are indeed, present."
2 Corinthians 10.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,12,"For we dare not match or compare our selues with certaine, that commend themselues: but we measure our selues in our selues, & compare our selues to our selues."
2 Corinthians 10.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,13,"But we wil not glorie aboue our measure: but according to the measure of the rule, which God hath measured to vs, a measure to reach euen vnto you."
2 Corinthians 10.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,14,"For not, as though we reached not vnto you, doe we extend ourselues beyond. For we are come as farre as to you in the Ghospel of Christ."
2 Corinthians 10.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,15,"not glorying aboue measure in other mens labours: but hauing hope of your faith increasing, to be magnified in you according to our Rule aboundantly,"
2 Corinthians 10.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,16,"yea vnto those places that are beyond you, to euangelize, not in another man's Rule, to glorie in in those things that are prepared before."
2 Corinthians 10.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,17,"But he that glorieth, let him glorie in our Lord."
2 Corinthians 10.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,10,18,"For not he that commendeth himself, the same is approued; but whom God commendeth."
2 Corinthians 11.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,1,Would God you could beare some litle of my folly: but doe ye also support me:
2 Corinthians 11.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,2,"for I emulate you with the emulation of God. For I haue despoused you to one man, to present you a chaste virgin vnto Christ."
2 Corinthians 11.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,3,"But I feare lest, as the serpent seduced Eue by his subteltie, so your senses may be corrupted, & fal from the simplicitie that is in Christ."
2 Corinthians 11.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,4,"For if he that commeth, preach another Christ whom we haue not preached, or you receiue another Christ whom we haue not preached, or you receiue another spirit whom you haue not receiued; or another Ghospel which you haue not receiued, you might wel suffer it."
2 Corinthians 11.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,5,For I suppose that I haue done nothing lesse then the great Apostles.
2 Corinthians 11.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,6,"For although rude in speach, yet not in knowledge. But in al things we are made manifest to you."
2 Corinthians 11.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,7,"Or did I commit a sinne humbling my self, that you might be exalted? because I euangelized vnto you the Ghospel of God gratis?"
2 Corinthians 11.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,8,"Other Churches I spoiled, taking a stipend, for your ministerie."
2 Corinthians 11.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,9,"And when I was with you, and had need, I was burdenous to none: for that which I wanted, the Brethren supplied that come from Macedonia: and in al things I haue kept my self without burden to you, and wil keep."
2 Corinthians 11.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,10,"The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shal not be infringed toward me in the countries of Achaia."
2 Corinthians 11.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,11,Wherfore? because I loue you not? God doth know.
2 Corinthians 11.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,12,"But that which I doe, I wil also doe, that I may cut away the occasion of them that desire occasion: that, in that which they glorie, they may be found euen like vs."
2 Corinthians 11.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,13,"For such false Apostles are craftie workers, transfiguring themselues into Apostles of Christ."
2 Corinthians 11.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,14,And no maruel: for Satan himself transfigureth himself into an Angel of light.
2 Corinthians 11.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,15,It is no great matter therfore if his Ministers be transfigured as the Ministers of iustice: whose end shal be according to their workes.
2 Corinthians 11.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,16,"Againe I say, (let no man thinke me to be foolish: otherwise take me as foolish, that I also may glorie a litle,)"
2 Corinthians 11.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,17,"that which I speake, I speake not according to God, but as it were in foolishnes, in this substance of glorying."
2 Corinthians 11.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,18,"Because many glorie according to the flesh, I also wil glorie."
2 Corinthians 11.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,19,For you doe gladly suffer the foolish: whereas your selues are wise.
2 Corinthians 11.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,20,"For you suffer if a man bring you into seruitude, if a man deuoure, if a man take, if a man be extolled, if a man strike you on the face."
2 Corinthians 11.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,21,"I speake according to dishonour, as though we had been weake in this part. Wherein any man dare (I speake folishly) I dare also."
2 Corinthians 11.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,22,They are Hebrewes: and I. They are Israelites: and I. They are the seed of Abraham; and I.
2 Corinthians 11.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,23,"They are the Ministers of Christ; and I. (I speake as one scarse wise) more I: in many moe labours, in prisons more aboundantly, in stripes aboue measure, in deaths often."
2 Corinthians 11.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,24,Of the Iewes fiue times did I receiue fortie sauing one.
2 Corinthians 11.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,25,"Thrise was I beaten with rods once I was stoned, thrise I suffred shipwrack; night and day haue I been in the depth of the sea,"
2 Corinthians 11.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,26,"in iourneying often, perils of waters, perils of theeues, perils of my Nation, perils of Gentils, perils in the citie, perils in the wildernes, perils in the sea, perils among false Brethren,"
2 Corinthians 11.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,27,"in labour and miserie, in much watchings, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in cold and nakednes,"
2 Corinthians 11.28 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,28,"beside those things which are outwardly: my daily instance, the carefulnes of al Churches."
2 Corinthians 11.29 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,29,"Who is weake, and I am not weake? Who is scandalized, and I am not burnt?"
2 Corinthians 11.30 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,30,If I must glorie: I wil glorie of the things that concerne my infirmitie.
2 Corinthians 11.31 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,31,"The God and Father of our Lord IESVS Christ, who is blessed for euer, knoweth that I lie not."
2 Corinthians 11.32 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,32,"At Damascus the Gouernour of the Nation vnder Aretas the King, kept the citie of the Damascenes for to apprehend me:"
2 Corinthians 11.33 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,11,33,"and through a window in a basket was I let downe by the wal, and so escaped his hands."
2 Corinthians 12.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,1,IF I must glorie (it is not expedient indeed) but I wil come to the visions & reuelations of our Lord.
2 Corinthians 12.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,2,"I know a man in Christ aboue fourteen yeares agoe (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not: God doth know) such a one rapt euento the third Heauen."
2 Corinthians 12.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,3,"And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not; God doth know)"
2 Corinthians 12.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,4,"that he was rapt into Paradise; & heard secret words, which it is not lawful for a man to speake."
2 Corinthians 12.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,5,"For such an one I wil glorie: but for my self I wil glorie nothing, sauing in my infirmities."
2 Corinthians 12.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,6,"For and if I wil glorie, I shal not be foolish: for I shal say truth. But I spare, lest any man should esteem me aboue that which he seeth in me, or heareth any thing of me."
2 Corinthians 12.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,7,"And lest the greatnes of the reuelations might extol me, there was giuen me a prick of my flesh, an Angel of Satan, to buffet me."
2 Corinthians 12.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,8,"For the which thing thrise I besought our Lord, that it might depart from me:"
2 Corinthians 12.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,9,"And he said to me: My grace sufficeth thee, for power is perfited in infirmitie. Gladly therfore wil I glorie in mine infirmitie, that the power of Christ may dwel in me."
2 Corinthians 12.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,10,"For the which cause I please my self in infirmities, in contumelies, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ. For when I am weake, then am I mightie."
2 Corinthians 12.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,11,I am become foolish: you haue compelled me. For I ought to haue been commended of you: for I haue been nothing lesse then they that are aboue measure Apostles: although I am nothing.
2 Corinthians 12.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,12,"Yet the signes of my Apostleship haue been done vpon you in al patience, in signes & wonders & mighty deeds."
2 Corinthians 12.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,13,For what is there that you haue had lesse then the other Churches; but that I my self haue not burdened you? Pardon me this iniurie.
2 Corinthians 12.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,14,"Behold, now the third time I am ready to come to you; & I wil not be burdenous vnto you. For I seeke not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children lay vp treasures for the parents, but the parents for the children."
2 Corinthians 12.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,15,"But I most gladly wil bestow & wil my self moreouer be bestowed for your soules: although louing you more, I am loued lesse."

2 Corinthians 12.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,17,Haue I circumuented you by any of them whom I sent to you?
2 Corinthians 12.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,18,"I requested Titus, and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus circumuent you? walked we not with one spirit? not in the self-same steps?"
2 Corinthians 12.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,19,Of old thinke you that we excuse our selues to you? Before God in Christ we speake: but al things (my Dearest) for your edifying.
2 Corinthians 12.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,20,"For I feare lest perhaps when I come, I find you not such as I would: and I be found of you such an one as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, emulations, stomakings, dissensions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions be among you."
2 Corinthians 12.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,12,21,"Lest againe when I come, God humble me among you: & I mourne many of them that sinned before, & haue not done penance for the vncleannes & fornication and incontinencie that they haue committed."
2 Corinthians 13.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,1,LOE this the third time I come vnto you: In the mouth of two or three witnesses shal euery word stand.
2 Corinthians 13.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,2,"I fore-told and doe fore-tel as present, and now absent, to them that sinned before, and al the rest, that if I come againe, I wil not spare."
2 Corinthians 13.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,3,"Seeke you an experiment of him that speaketh in me, Christ; who in you is not weake, but is mightie in you?"
2 Corinthians 13.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,4,For although he was crucified of infirmitie; yet he liueth by the power of God. For we also are weake in him: but we shal liue with him by the power of God on you.
2 Corinthians 13.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,5,"Trie your owne selues if you be in the faith, proue ye your selues. Know you not your selues that Christ IESVS is in you, vnlesse perhaps you be reprobates."
2 Corinthians 13.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,6,But I hope you know that we are not reprobates.
2 Corinthians 13.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,7,"And we pray God, that you doe no euil, not that we may appeare approued, but that you may doe that which is good, and we be as reprobates."
2 Corinthians 13.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,8,For we can not any thing against the truth; but for the truth.
2 Corinthians 13.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,9,"For we reioyce, for that we are weake, and you are mightie. This also we pray for, your consummation."
2 Corinthians 13.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,10,Therfore these things I write absent: That being present I may not deale hardly according to the power which our Lord hath giuen me vnto edification and not vnto destruction.
2 Corinthians 13.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,2 Corinthians,13,11,"For the rest, Brethren, reioyce, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, haue peace; and the God of peace & of loue shal be with you."

Galatians 1.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,1,10,"For doe I now vse persuasion to men, or to God? Or doe I seeke to please men? If I yet did please men, I should not be the seruant of Christ."
Galatians 1.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,1,11,"For I doe you to vnderstand, Brethren, the Ghospel that was euangelized of me, that it is not according to man."
Galatians 1.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,1,12,"For neither did I receiue it of man, nor learne it; but by the reuelation of IESVS Christ."
Galatians 1.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,1,13,"For you haue heard my conuersation sometime in Iudaisme, that aboue measure I persecuted the Church of God, and expugned it,"
Galatians 1.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,1,14,"and profited in Iudaisme aboue many of mine equales in my Nation, being more abundantly an emulatour of the traditions of my Fathers."
Galatians 1.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,1,15,"But when it pleased him that separated me from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace, to reueale his Sonne in me,"
Galatians 1.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,1,16,"that I should euangelize him among the Gentils, incontinent I condescended not to flesh and bloud,"

Galatians 2.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,2,"And I went vp according to reuelation: and conferred with them the Ghospel which I preach among Gentils, but apart with them that seemed to be some-thing, lest perhaps in vaine I should runne or had runne."
Galatians 2.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,3,"But neither Titus which was with me, whereas he was a Gentil, was compelled to be circumcised:"
Galatians 2.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,4,"but because of the false Brethren craftily brought in, which craftily came in to espie our libertie that we haue in Christ IESVS, that they might bring vs into seruitude."
Galatians 2.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,5,"To whom we yealded not subiection no not for an houre, that the truth of the Ghospel may remaine with you."
Galatians 2.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,6,"But of them that seemed to be some-thing, (what they were some-time, it is nothing to me. God accepteth not the person of man) for to me, they that seemd to be something, added nothing."
Galatians 2.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,7,"But contrariewise when they had seen, that to me was committed the Ghospel of the prepuce, as to Peter of the circumcision"
Galatians 2.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,8,"(for he that wrought in Peter to the Apostleship of circumcision, wrought in me also among the Gentils)"
Galatians 2.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,9,"and when they had knowen the grace that was giuen me, Iames and Cephas and Iohn, which seemed to be pillars, gaue to me and Barnabas the right hands of societie: that we vnto the Gentils, & they vnto the circumcision:"
Galatians 2.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,10,only that we should be mindful of the poore: the which same thing also I was careful to doe.
Galatians 2.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,11,"And when Cephas was come to Antioche, I resisted him in face, beacause he was reprehensible."
Galatians 2.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,12,"For before that certaine came from Iames, he did eate with the Gentils: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision."
Galatians 2.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,13,"And to his simulation consented the rest of the Iewes, so that Barnabas also was led of them into that simulation."
Galatians 2.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they walked not rightly to the veritie of the Ghospel, I said to Cephas before them al: If thou being a Iew, liuest Gentil-like and not Iudaically, how doest thou compel the Gentils to Iudaize?"
Galatians 2.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,15,"We are by nature Iewes, and not of the Gentils, sinners."
Galatians 2.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,16,"But knowing that man is not iustified by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of IESVS Christ; we also beleeue in Christ IESVS, that we may be iustified by the faith of Christ, and not by the workes of the Law: for the which cause, by the workes of the Law no flesh shal be iustified."
Galatians 2.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,17,"But if seeking to be iustified in Christ, our selues also be found sinners; is Christ then a Minister of sinne? God forbid."
Galatians 2.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,18,"For if I build the same things againe which I haue destroied, I make my self a preuaricatour."
Galatians 2.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,19,"For I by the Law, am dead to the Law, that I may liue to God: with Christ I am nailed to the crosse."
Galatians 2.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,20,"And I liue, now not I; but Christ liueth in me. And that that I liue now in the flesh, I liue in the faith of the Sonne of God, who loued me, and deliuered himself for me."
Galatians 2.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,2,21,"I cast not away the grace of God. For if iustice be by the Law, then Christ died in vaine."
Galatians 3.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,1,"O senses Galatians, who hath bewitched you, not to obey the truth, before whose eyes IESVS Christ was proscribed, being crucified among you?"
Galatians 3.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,2,"This only I would learne of you: By the workes of the Law, did you receiue the Spirit, or by the hearing of the faith?"
Galatians 3.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,3,"Are you so foolish, that whereas you began with the Spirit, now you wil be consummate with the flesh?"
Galatians 3.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,4,Haue you suffered so great things without cause? if yet without cause.
Galatians 3.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,5,"He therfore that giueth you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you; by the workes of the Law, or by the hearing of the faith doeth he it?"
Galatians 3.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,6,"As, Abraham beleeued God, and it was reputed to him vnto iustice."
Galatians 3.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,7,"Know ye therfore that they that are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."
Galatians 3.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,8,"And the Scripture fore-seeing that God iustifieth the Gentils by faith, shewed vnto Abraham before, That in thee shal al Nations be blessed."
Galatians 3.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,9,"Therfore they that are of faith, shal be blessed with the faithful Abraham."
Galatians 3.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,10,"For whosoeuer are of the workes of the Law, are vnder curse. For it is written: Cursed be euery one that abideth not in al things that be written in the booke of the Law, to doe them."
Galatians 3.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,11,"But that in the Law no man is iustified with God, it is manifest, because the iust liueth by faith."
Galatians 3.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,12,"But the Law is not by faith: but, He that doeth those things, shal liue in them."
Galatians 3.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,13,"Christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for vs (because it is written: Cursed is euery one that hangeth on a tree)"
Galatians 3.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,14,that on the Gentils the blessing of Abraham might be made in Christ IESVS: that we may receiue the promise of the Spirit by faith.
Galatians 3.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,15,"Brethren (I speake according to man) yet a man's testament being confirmed no man despiseth, or further disposeth."
Galatians 3.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,16,"To Abraham were the promises said, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as in many: but as in one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
Galatians 3.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,17,"And this I say, the testament being confirmed of God, the Law which was made after foure hundred and thirtie yeares, maketh not void to frustrate the promise."
Galatians 3.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,18,"For if the inheritance be of the Law, now not of promise. But God gaue it to Abraham by promise."
Galatians 3.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,19,"Why was the Law then? It was put for transgressions, vntil the seed came to whom he had promised: ordeined by Angels in the hand of a Mediatour."
Galatians 3.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,20,And a Mediatour is not of one: but God is one.
Galatians 3.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,21,"Was the Law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a Law giuen that could iustifie, vndoubtedly iustice should be of the Law."
Galatians 3.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,22,But the Scripture hath concluded al things vnder sinne: that the promise by the faith of IESVS Christ might be giuen to them that beleeue.
Galatians 3.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,23,"But before the faith came, vnder the Law we were kept shut vp, vnto that faith which was to be reuealed."
Galatians 3.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,24,Therfore the Law was our Pedagogue in Christ: that we may be iustified by faith.
Galatians 3.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,25,"But when the faith came, now we are not vnder a Pedagogue."
Galatians 3.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,3,26,For you are al the children of God by faith in Christ IESVS.

Galatians 4.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,1,"AND I say, as long as the heire is a litle one, he differeth nothing from a seruant, although he be Lord of al,"
Galatians 4.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,2,But is vnder tutours and gouernours vntil the time limited of the Father:
Galatians 4.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,3,"so we also, when we were litle ones, were seruing vnder the elements of the world."
Galatians 4.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,4,"But when the fulnes of time came, God sent his Sonne made of a woman, made vnder the Law:"

Galatians 4.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,6,"And because you are sonnes, God hath sent the Spirit of his sonne into your harts crying: Abba, Father."
Galatians 4.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,7,"Therfore now he is not a seruant, but a sonne. And if a sonne, an heire also by God."

Galatians 4.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,13,And you know that by infirmitie of the flesh I euangelized to you heretofore:
Galatians 4.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,14,"and your tentation in my flesh you despised not, neither reiected, but as an Angel of God you receiued me, as Christ IESVS."
Galatians 4.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,15,"Where is then your blessednes? for I giue you testimonie that if it could be done, you would haue plucked out your eyes and haue giuen them to me."
Galatians 4.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,16,"Am I then become your enemie, telling you the truth?"
Galatians 4.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,17,"They emulate you not wel: but they would exclude you, that you might emulate them."
Galatians 4.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,18,But doe you emulate the good in good alwaies: and not only when I am present with you.
Galatians 4.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,19,"My litle children, whom I trauail withal againe, vntil Christ be formed in you."
Galatians 4.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,20,And I would be with you now and change my voice: because I am confounded in you.
Galatians 4.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,21,"Tel me, you that wil be vnder the law, haue you not read the Law?"
Galatians 4.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sonnes: one of the bond-woman, and one of the free-woman."
Galatians 4.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,23,"But he that of the bond-woman, was borne according to the flesh: and he that of the free-woman, by the promise."
Galatians 4.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,24,"Which things are said by an allegorie. For these are the two Testaments. The one from mount Sina, gendring vnto bondage; which is Agar,"

Galatians 4.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,26,"But that Hierusalem which is aboue, is free; which is our mother."
Galatians 4.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,27,"For it is written: Reioyce thou barren, that bearest not: breake forth and crie, that trauailest not: because many are the children of the desolate, more then of her that hath a husband."

Galatians 4.30 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,30,But what saith the Scripture? Cast out the bond-woman and her sonne. For the sonne of the bond-woman shal not be heire with the sonne of the free-woman.
Galatians 4.31 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Galatians,4,31,"Therfore, Brethren, we are not the children of the bond-woman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ hath made vs free."

Hebrews 7.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,7,14,For it is manifest that our Lord sprung if Iuda: in the which Tribe Moyses spake nothing of Priestes.
Hebrews 7.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,7,15,"And yet it is much more euident: if according to the similitude of Melchisedech there arise another Priest,"
Hebrews 7.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,7,16,"which was not made according to the Law of the carnal commandement, but according to the power of life indissoluble."

Hebrews 7.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,7,25,whereby he is able to saue also for euer going by himself to God: alwaies liuing to make intercession for vs.
Hebrews 7.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,7,26,"For it was seemely that we should haue such a high Priest, holy, innocent, impolluted, separated from sinners, and made higher then the Heauens."
Hebrews 7.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,7,27,"which hath not necessitie daily (as the Priestes) first for his owne sinnes to offer Hostes, then for the peoples. For this he did once, in offering himself."
Hebrews 7.28 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,7,28,"For the Law appointeth Priestes men that haue infirmitie: but the word of the othe which is after the Law, the Sonne for euer perfected."
Hebrews 8.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,1,"BVT the summe concerning those things which be said, is: We haue such an high Priest, who is set on the right hand of the seat of maiestie in the heauens."
Hebrews 8.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,2,"A Minister of the Holies, and of the true tabernacle, which our Lord pight and not man."
Hebrews 8.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,3,"For euery high Priest is appointed to offer guifts and hosts, wherfore it is necessarie that he also haue some thing that he may offer:"
Hebrews 8.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,4,"if then he were vpon the earth, neither were he a Priest: whereas there were that did offer guifts according to the Law,"
Hebrews 8.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,5,"that serue the exampler and shadow of heauenly things. As it was answered Moyses, when he finished the tabernacle, See (quoth he) that thou make al things according to the exampler which was shewed thee in the mount."
Hebrews 8.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,6,"But now he hath obtained a better ministerie, by so much as he is Mediatour of a better Testament, which is established in better promises."
Hebrews 8.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,7,"For if that former had been void of fault, there should not certes a place of a second been sought."
Hebrews 8.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,8,"For blaming them, he saith: Behold the daies shal come, saith our Lord: and I wil consummate vpon the house if Israel, and vpon the house of Iuda a new Testament:"
Hebrews 8.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,9,"not according to the Testament which I made to their Fathers in the day that I tooke their hand to bring them out of the land of AEgypt: because they did not continue in my Testament: and I neglected them, saith our Lord."
Hebrews 8.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,10,"For this is the Testament which I wil dispose to the house of Israel after those daies, saith our Lord: Giuing my lawes into their mind, and in their hart wil I superscribe them: and I wil be their God, and they shal be my people:"
Hebrews 8.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,11,"and euery one shal not teach his neighbour, and euery one his brother, saying, Know our Lord: because al shal know me from the lesser to the greater of them:"
Hebrews 8.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,12,"because I wil be merciful to their iniquities, & their sinnes I wil not now remember."
Hebrews 8.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,8,13,"And in saying a new, the former he hath made old. And that which groweth ancient and waxed old is nigh to vtter decay."
Hebrews 9.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,1,"THE former also indeed had iustifications of seruice, and a secular sanctuarie."
Hebrews 9.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,2,"For the tabernacle was made, the first, wherein were the candlestickes, and the table, and the proposition of loaues, which is called Holy."
Hebrews 9.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,3,"But after the second veile, the tabernacle, which is called Sancta Sanctorum:"
Hebrews 9.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,4,"hauing a golden censar, and the arke of the Testament couered about on euery part with gold, in the which was a golden pot hauing Manna, and the rod of Aaron that had blossomed, and the tables of the Testament,"
Hebrews 9.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,5,"and ouer it were the Cherubins of glorie ouer-shadowing the propitiatorie, of which thing it is not needful to speake now particularly."
Hebrews 9.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,6,"But these things being so ordered, in the first tabernacle indeed the Priests alwaies entred, accomplishing offices of the Sacrifices."
Hebrews 9.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,7,"But in the second, once a yeare the high Priest only: not without bloud which he offereth for his owne and the peoples ignorance:"
Hebrews 9.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,8,"the Holy Ghost signifying this, that the way of the Holies was not yet manifested, the former tabernacle as yet standing."
Hebrews 9.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,9,"Which is a parable of the time present: according to which are offered guifts and hosts, which can not concerning the conscience make perfect him that serueth,"
Hebrews 9.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,10,"only in meats and in drinkes, and diuerse baptismes, and iustices of the flesh laid on them vntil the time of correction."
Hebrews 9.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ assisting an high Priest of the good things to come, by a more ample and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:"
Hebrews 9.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,12,"neither by the bloud of goats or of calues, but by his owne bloud entred in once into the Holies, eternal redemption being found."
Hebrews 9.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,13,"For if the bloud of goats and oxen and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled, sanctifieth the polluted to the cleansing of the flesh,"
Hebrews 9.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,14,"how much more hath the bloud of Christ who by the Holy Ghost offered himself vnspotted vnto God, cleansed our conscience from dead workes, to serue the liuing God?"
Hebrews 9.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,15,"And therfore he is the Mediatour of the new Testament: that death being a meane, vnto the redemption of these preuarications which were vnder the former Testament, they that are called may receiue the promise of eternal inheritance."
Hebrews 9.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,16,For where there is a testament: the death of the testatour must of necessitie come between.
Hebrews 9.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,17,"For a Testament is confirmed in the dead: otherwise it is yet of no value, whiles the testatour liueth."
Hebrews 9.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,18,Whereupon neither was the first certes dedicated without bloud.
Hebrews 9.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,19,"For al the commandement of the Law being read of Moyses to al the people: he taking the bloud of calues and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, sprinkled the very book also it self and al the people,"
Hebrews 9.20 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,20,"saying, This is the bloud of the Testament, which God hath commanded vnto you."
Hebrews 9.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,21,The tabernacle also & al the vessel of the ministerie he in like manner sprinkled with bloud.
Hebrews 9.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,22,And al things almost according to the law are cleansed with bloud: and without sheading of bloud there is not remission.
Hebrews 9.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,23,It is necessarie therfore that the examplers of the celestials be cleansed with these: but the celestials themselues with better hosts then these.
Hebrews 9.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,24,"For IESVS is not entred into Holies made with hand, examplers of the true: but into Heauen it-self, that he may appeare now to the countenance of God for vs."
Hebrews 9.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,25,"Nor that he should offer himself often, as the high Priest entreth into the Holies, euery yeare in the bloud of others:"
Hebrews 9.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,26,"otherwise he ought to haue suffered often from the beginning of the world: but now once in the consummation of the worlds, to the destruction of sinne, he hath appeared by his owne host."
Hebrews 9.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,27,"And as it is appointed to men to die once, and after this, the iudgement:"
Hebrews 9.28 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,9,28,"so also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sinnes of many. The second time he shal appeare without sinne to them that expect him, vnto saluation."
Hebrews 10.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,1,"FOR the law hauing a shadow of good things to come, not the very image of the things: euery yeare with the self-same hosts which they offer incessantly, can neuer make the commers thereto perfect:"
Hebrews 10.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,2,"otherwise they should haue ceased to be offered, because the worshippers once cleansed should haue no conscience of sinne any longer."
Hebrews 10.3 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,3,But in them there is made a commemoration of sinnes euery yeare.
Hebrews 10.4 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,4,For it is impossible that with the bloud of oxen and goats sinnes should be taken away.
Hebrews 10.5 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,5,Therfore comming into the world he saith: Host and oblation thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me:
Hebrews 10.6 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,6,Holocausts and for sinne did not please thee.
Hebrews 10.7 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,7,"Then said I, Behold I come: in the head of the booke it is written of me: That I may doe thy wil, o God."
Hebrews 10.8 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,8,"Saying before, Because hosts and oblations & holocausts, & for sinne thou wouldest not, neither did they please thee, which are offered according to the law,"
Hebrews 10.9 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,9,"then said I, Behold I come that I may doe thy wil, o God: he taketh away the first, that he may establish that that felloweth."
Hebrews 10.10 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,10,"In the which wil, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of IESVS Christ once."
Hebrews 10.11 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,11,"And euery Priest indeed is ready daily ministring, and often offering the same hosts, which can neuer take away sinnes:"
Hebrews 10.12 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,12,"but This offering one host for sinnes, for euer sitteth on the right hand of God,"
Hebrews 10.13 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,13,"hence-forth expecting, vntil his enemies be put the foot-stool of his feet."
Hebrews 10.14 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,14,For by one oblation hath he consummated for euer them that are sanctified.
Hebrews 10.15 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,15,And the Holy Ghost also doth testifie to vs. For after that he said:
Hebrews 10.16 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,16,"And this is the Testament which I wil make to them after those daies, saith our Lord, giuing my lawes in their harts, and in their minds wil I superscribe them:"
Hebrews 10.17 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,17,and their sinnes and iniquities I wil now remember no more.
Hebrews 10.18 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,18,"But where there is remission of these, now there is not an oblation for sinnes."
Hebrews 10.19 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,19,"Hauing therfore, Brethren, confidence in the entring of the Holies in the bloud of Christ:"

Hebrews 10.21 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,21,"and a high Priest ouer the house of God,"
Hebrews 10.22 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,22,"let vs approche with a true hart in fulnesse of faith, hauing our harts sprinkled from euil conscience, and our body washed with cleane water."
Hebrews 10.23 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,23,Let vs hold the confession of our hope vndeclining (for he is faithful that hath promised)
Hebrews 10.24 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,24,and let vs consider one another vnto the prouocation of charitie and of good workes:
Hebrews 10.25 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,25,"not forsaking our assemblie as some are accustomed, but comforting, and so much the more as you see the day approching."
Hebrews 10.26 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,26,"For if we sinne willingly after the knowledge of the truth receiued, now there is not left an host for sinnes,"
Hebrews 10.27 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,27,"but a certaine terrible expectation of iudgement & rage of fire, which shal consume the aduersaries."
Hebrews 10.28 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,28,"A man making the Law of Moyses frustrate, without any mercie dieth vnder two or three witnesses."

Hebrews 10.30 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,30,"For we know him that said, Reuenge to me, I wil repay. And againe, That our Lord wil iudge his people."
Hebrews 10.31 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,31,It is horrible to fal into the hands of the liuing God.

Hebrews 10.34 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,10,34,"For, you both had compassion on them that were in bands: and the spoile of your owne goods you tooke with ioy, knowing that you haue a better and a permanent substance."

Hebrews 11.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,Hebrews,11,1,"AND faith is, the substance of things to be hoped for, the argument of things not appearing."

James 4.1 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,James,4,1,FROM whence are warres and contentions among you? Are they not hereof? of your concupiscences which warre in your members?
James 4.2 (ODRV),ODRV,New Testament,James,4,2,"You couet, & haue not. You kil, and enuie; and can not obtaine. You contend and warre: and you haue not, because you aske not."

Wisdom 2.2 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,2,2,"because of nothing were we borne, and after this, we shal be as if we had not bene: because the breath is a smoke in our nosthrels: & speach a sparke to moue our hart."
Wisdom 2.3 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,2,3,"Which being extinguished, our bodie shal be ashes, and the spirit shal be powred abrode as soft ayre, and our life shal passe as the trace of a cloude, and shal be dissolued as a mist, which is driuen away by the beames of the sunne, and oppressed with the heate therof:"

Wisdom 5.11 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,5,11,"or as a bird, that flyeth through in the ayre, of which there is no token can be found of her passage, but only a sound of the winges beating the light winde: and by vehemence of going cutting the ayre, mouing the winges she is flowen through, and afterward there is no signe found of her way:"
Wisdom 5.12 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,5,12,"or as when an arrow is shotte forth to a sette marke, the diuided ayre is forthwith closed in itself againe, so that the passage therof is not knowen:"
Wisdom 5.13 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,5,13,so we also being born forthwith ceased to be: and of vertue certes haue bene able to shew no signe: but in our naughtines we are consumed.
Wisdom 5.14 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,5,14,"Such thinges sayd they in hel, which sinned:"
Wisdom 5.15 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,5,15,"because the hope of the impious is as dust, which is taken away with the winde: and as a thinne froth, which is dispersed by the storme: and as smoke that is scatered abrode by the winde: and as the memorie of a ghest of one day that passeth."

Wisdom 5.18 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,5,18,"And his zele wil take armour, and he wil arme the creature to the reuenge of the enemies."
Wisdom 5.19 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,5,19,"He wil put on iustice for a brestplate, & wil take sincere iudgement for an helmet:"
Wisdom 5.20 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,5,20,he wil take equitie for an inuincible shilde:
Wisdom 5.21 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,5,21,"and he wil sharpen fierce wrath for a speare, and the round world shal fight with him against the senslesse."

Wisdom 6.4 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,4,"because the powre is geuen you of our Lord, and strength by the Highest, who wil examine your workes, and search your cogitations:"
Wisdom 6.5 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,5,"because when you were the ministers of his kingdom, you iudged not rightly, nor kept the law of iustice, nor haue walked according to the wil of God."
Wisdom 6.6 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,6,"Horribly and quickly wil he appeare to you: because most seuere iudgement shal be done on them, that beare rule."
Wisdom 6.7 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,7,For to the litle one mercie is granted: but the mightie shal mightely suffer torments.
Wisdom 6.8 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,8,"For God wil not except any mans person, neither wil feare the greatnes of any man: because he made the litle and the great, & he hath equally care of al."
Wisdom 6.9 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,9,But to the stronger more strong torment is imminent.

Wisdom 6.13 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,13,"Wisdom is cleere, and such as neuer fadeth, and is easely sene of them that loue her, and is found of them that seeke her."
Wisdom 6.14 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,14,"She preuenteth them that couete her, that she first may shew herself vnto them."
Wisdom 6.15 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,15,"He that awaketh early to her, shal not labour: for he shal find her sitting at her doores."
Wisdom 6.16 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,16,"To thinke therfore of her, is perfect vnderstanding: and he that watcheth for her, shal quickly be secure."
Wisdom 6.17 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,17,"Because she goeth about seeking them that be worthie of her, and in the wayes she wil shew her self to them cheerefully, and in al prouidence she wil meete them."
Wisdom 6.18 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,18,For the beginning of her is the most true desire of discipline.
Wisdom 6.19 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,19,"The care therfore of discipline, is loue: and loue, is the keeping of her lawes: and the keeping of the lawes, is the consummation of incorruption:"
Wisdom 6.20 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,20,and incorruption maketh to be next to God.
Wisdom 6.21 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,21,Therfore the desire of wisdom leadeth to the euerlasting kingdom.
Wisdom 6.22 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,22,"If therfore you be delighted with thrones, and with scepters o ye kinges of the people, loue wisdom, that you may reigne for euer."

Wisdom 6.24 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,24,"But what wisdom is, and how she was made, I wil declare: and I wil not hide from you the mysteries of God, but from the beginning of her natiuitie I wil search out, and sette the knowledge of her into light, and wil not let passe the truth:"
Wisdom 6.25 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,25,neither wil I goe with pyning enuie: because such a man shal not be partaker of wisdom.
Wisdom 6.26 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,26,But the multitude of the wise is the health of the round world: and a wise king is the stabilitie of the people.
Wisdom 6.27 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,6,27,"Therfore take ye discipline by my wordes, and it shal profite you."
Wisdom 7.1 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,1,"I also certes am a mortal man, like to al, and of the earthlie kinred of him, that was made first, and in the wombe of my mother was I fashioned flesh,"

Wisdom 7.4 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,4,"I was nourished in swadling clothes, and great cares."

Wisdom 7.7 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,7,"For this cause I wished, and vnderstanding was geuen me: and I inuocated, and the spirit of wisdom came vpon me:"
Wisdom 7.8 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,8,"and I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones, and riches I counted to be nothing in comparison of her."
Wisdom 7.9 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,9,"Neither did I compare the precious stone to her: because al gold in comparison of her, is a litle sand, and siluer in the sight of her shal be estemed as clay."
Wisdom 7.10 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,10,"Aboue health and beautie did I loue her, and purposed to haue her for light: because her light can not be extinguished."
Wisdom 7.11 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,11,"And al good thinges came to me together with her, and very much honestie by her handes,"
Wisdom 7.12 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,12,"and I reioyced in al because this wisdom went before me, and I was ignorant that she is the mother of al these."
Wisdom 7.13 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,13,"Which I lerned without fiction, and doe communicate without enuie, and her honestie I hid not."
Wisdom 7.14 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,14,"For she is an infinite treasure to men: which who so haue, are made partakers of the frenship of God, commended for the gifts of discipline."
Wisdom 7.15 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,15,"And to me God hath geuen to speake according to my minde, and to presume thinges worthie of those, that are geuen me: because he is the guide of wisdom, and the creator of the wise:"
Wisdom 7.16 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,16,"for in his hand are both we, & our wordes, and wisdom, and the knowledge of discipline of workes."
Wisdom 7.17 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,17,"For he gaue me the true knowledge of those thinges, which are: that I may know the disposition of the round world, and the vertues of the elements,"
Wisdom 7.18 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,18,"the beginning, & end, & middes of times, the permutations of changeable seasons, and consummations of times,"
Wisdom 7.19 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,19,"the courses of the yeare, and dispositions of the starres,"
Wisdom 7.20 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,7,20,"the natures of beastes, and furies of wilde beastes, the force of windes, and the cogitations of men, the differences of plantes, and vertues of rootes,"

Wisdom 12.10 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,10,"but iudging by partes thou gauest place of repentance, being not ignorant, that the nation of them is wicked, and their malice natural, & that their cogitation could not be changed for euer."
Wisdom 12.11 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,11,"For it was cursed seede from the begynning: neither fearing any, didst thou geue pardon to their sinnes."
Wisdom 12.12 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,12,"For who shal say to thee: what hast thou done? or who shal stand against thy iudgement? or who in thy sight shal come reuenger of the wicked men? or who shal impute it to thee, if the nations perish, which thou hast made?"
Wisdom 12.13 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,13,"For there is no other God but thou, who hast care of al, that thou mayst shew that thou doest not geue iudgement vniustly."

Wisdom 12.15 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,15,"For so much then as thou art iust, thou doest dispose al thinges iustly: thou also estemest it disagreable from thy powre, to condemne him, who ought not to be punished."
Wisdom 12.16 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,16,"For thy powre is the begynning of iustice: and for this that thou art Lord of al, thou makest thyself to spare al."
Wisdom 12.17 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,17,"From thou shewest powre, which art not thought to be absolute in powre, and thou conuincest the boldnes of them, that know thee not."

Wisdom 12.19 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,19,"And thou hast taught thy people by such workes, that they must be iust and gentle, and hast made thy children of good hope: because iudging thou geuest in sinnes place of repentance."
Wisdom 12.20 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,20,"For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy servants, and that deserved to die, with so great consideration, geuing time and place, whereby they might be changed from their wickednes."
Wisdom 12.21 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,21,"With what diligence hast thou iudged thy children, to whose parents thou gauest othes and couenants of good promises?"
Wisdom 12.22 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,22,"Therfore when thou geuest vs discipline, thou scourgest our enemies very manie wayes, that iudging we may thinke vpon thy goodnes: and when we are iudged, we may hope for thy mercie."
Wisdom 12.23 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,23,"Wherfore to them also, which in their life haue liued foolishly & vniustly, thou hast geuen great torments by the same thinges, which they did worshipe."
Wisdom 12.24 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,24,"For they wandred long in the way of errour, esteming for goddes those thinges, that in beasts are superfluous, liuing after the maner of sensles infants."
Wisdom 12.25 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,25,For this cause thou hast geuen iudgement on them as on sensles children to be in derision.
Wisdom 12.26 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,26,"But they that were not amanded by scornes and reprehensions, haue tried the worthie iudgement of God."
Wisdom 12.27 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,12,27,"For in what thinges they suffering tooke indignation, by those whom they thought goddes, when seing they were destroyed in them, him, whom in time past they denied that they knewe, they acknowledged the true God: for the which cause the end also of their condemnation shal come vpon them."
Wisdom 13.1 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,1,"BVT al men be vaine, in Whom there is not the knowledge of God: and of these good thinges, which are sene, they could not vnderstand him that is, neither attending to the workes haue they agnised who the workeman:"
Wisdom 13.2 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,2,"but either the fyre, or the wind, or the swift ayre, or a circle of starres or exceding much water, or the sunne and the moone, they thought to be goddes, rulers of the world."
Wisdom 13.3 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,3,"With whose beautie if being delighted, they thought them goddes: let them know how much the Lord of them is more beautiful then they. For the author of beautie made al those thinges."
Wisdom 13.4 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,4,"Or if they merueled at their vertue, & operations, let them vnderstand by them, that he which made these, is stronger then they:"
Wisdom 13.5 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,5,"for by the greatnes of the beautie, and of the creature the creator of them may be sene, to be knowen therby."
Wisdom 13.6 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,6,"But not withstanding there is yet in these lesse complainte. For they also perhaps erre, seeking God, and desirous to finde him."
Wisdom 13.7 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,7,"For wheras they conuerse in his workes, they enquire: & they are perswaded that the thinges be good which are seene."
Wisdom 13.8 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,8,But againe neither ought these to be pardoned.
Wisdom 13.9 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,9,"For if they could know so much, that they were able to estimate the world: how did they not more easely find the Lord therof?"
Wisdom 13.10 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,10,"But they are vnhappie, & their hope is among the dead, who haue called the workes of mens handes goddes, gold and siluer, the inuention of art, and the similitudes of beastes, or an vnprofitable stone the worke of an old hand."
Wisdom 13.11 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,11,"Or if an artificer a carpenter, cut streight timber out of the wood, & pare of al the barke therof cunningly, and vsing his art, diligently frameth a vessel profitable for the common vse of this life,"
Wisdom 13.12 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,12,and vseth the chippes of that worke to dresse his meate:
Wisdom 13.13 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,13,"and maketh that which is left therof, which is for no vses, but being a crooked peece of wood, and ful of knobes, carueth it diligently in the holownes therof, and by the skil of his art fashioneth it, and maketh it like to the image of a man,"
Wisdom 13.14 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,14,"or compareth it to some beast, straking it ouer with redde, and with paynting making the colour therof ruddie, and layeth a colour ouer euerie spot that is in it:"
Wisdom 13.15 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,15,"and maketh a worthie habitation for it, and setting it in a wal, and fastening it with yron;"
Wisdom 13.16 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,16,"lest perhaps it fal, prouiding for it, knowing that it can not helpe it selfe: for it is an image, and it nedeth help."
Wisdom 13.17 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,17,"And concerning his substance, & his children, & for mariage, making a vow he seeketh to it. He is not ashamed to speake with him, that is without soule:"
Wisdom 13.18 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,18,"and for health certes he besecheth the weake, and for life asketh the dead, and for helpe innocateth him that is vnprofitable:"
Wisdom 13.19 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,13,19,"and for a iourney asketh him, that can not walke: and for getting, and for working, and for the euent of al thinges he asketh him, that in al is vnprofitable."
Wisdom 14.1 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,1,"AGAYNE an other thinking to sayle, and begynning to make a iourney through the fierce waues, inuocateth wood more fraile then the wood that carieth him."
Wisdom 14.2 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,2,"For couetousnes of getting inuented it, and the craftesman by his wisdom framed it."
Wisdom 14.3 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,3,"But thy prouidence, o Father, doth gouerne: because thou hast geuen a way euen in the sea, and among the waues a most sure path,"
Wisdom 14.4 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,4,"shewing that thou art able to saue out of al thinges, yea if a man goe to the sea without art."
Wisdom 14.5 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,5,"But that thy workes might not be voyde of wisdom: for this cause also men commit their liues euen to a little wood, and passing ouer the sea are deliuered by shippe."
Wisdom 14.6 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,6,"But from the begynning also when the prowde giants perished, the hope of the world fleing to a shippe, rendered to the world seede of natiuitie, which was gouerned by thy hand."
Wisdom 14.7 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,7,"For blessed is the wood, by the which iustice is made."
Wisdom 14.8 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,8,"But the idol that is made by handes, cursed is both it, and he that made it: because he in deede wrought it: and the same being fraile, was called god."
Wisdom 14.9 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,9,But to God the impious and his impietie are odious alike.
Wisdom 14.10 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,10,"For that which is made, with him that made it, shal suffer torments."
Wisdom 14.11 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,11,"For this cause also in the idol of the nations there shal be no respect: because the creatures of God were made to hatred, and for tentation to the soules of men, and for a snare to the feete of the vnwise."
Wisdom 14.12 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,12,For the begynning of fornication is the deuising of idols: and the inuenting of them is the corruption of life.
Wisdom 14.13 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,13,"For neither were they from the begynning, neither shal they be for euer."
Wisdom 14.14 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,14,For this vanitie of men came into the world: and therfore there is found a short end of them.
Wisdom 14.15 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,15,"For the father being sorowful with bitter moorning, made vnto himselfe the image of his sonne quickly taken away: and him, that then was a dead man, now he began to worshipe as god, and appointed holie thinges and sacrifices among his seruants."
Wisdom 14.16 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,16,"Afterward by succession of time, the wicked custom preuayling, this errour was kept as a law, and thinges grauen were worshipped by the commandement of tyrants."
Wisdom 14.17 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,17,"And those, whom openly men could not honour, for that they were far of, their figure being brought from a far, they made an euident image of the king, whom they would honour: that by their carefulnes they might honour as present, him that was absent."
Wisdom 14.18 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,18,"And to the worshipping of these, the excellent diligence also of the artificer, holpe them forward, that were ignorant."
Wisdom 14.19 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,19,"For he willing to please him, that entertained him, laboured by his art, to fashion the similitude in better sort."
Wisdom 14.20 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,20,"And the multitude of men caried away by the beautie of the worke, him that a little before had bene honoured as a man, now they estemed for a god."
Wisdom 14.21 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,21,"And this was the deceyuing of mans life: because men seruing either affection, or kinges, gaue the name that is not communicable to stones and wood."
Wisdom 14.22 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,22,"And it was not sufficient that they erred about the knowledge of God, but also liuing in a great battail of ignorance so manie and so great euils they cal peace."
Wisdom 14.23 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,23,"For either sacrificing their children, or making abscure sacrifices, or hauing watches ful of madnes,"
Wisdom 14.24 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,24,"they now neither keepe life, nor mariage cleane, but one killeth an other by enuie, or playing the adulterer maketh him sorowful:"
Wisdom 14.25 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,25,"and al thinges are mingled together, bloud, manslaughter, theft and fiction, corruption, and infidelitie, truble, and periurie, disquieting of the good,"
Wisdom 14.26 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,26,"forgetfulnes of God, inquination of soules, immutation of natiuitie, inconstancie of mariage, disorder of adulterie, and vnchastnes."
Wisdom 14.27 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,27,"For the worshippe of idols not to be named, is the cause of al euil, and the beginning and end."
Wisdom 14.28 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,28,"For either when they reioyce, they are madde: or certes prophecie false thinges, or liue vniustly, or quickly forsweare themselues."
Wisdom 14.29 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,29,"For whiles they trust in idols, which are without soule, swearing amisse they hope not to be hurt."
Wisdom 14.30 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,30,"Two euil thinges therfore shal happen to them worthely, because they haue thought euil of God, attending to idols, and haue sworne vniustly, in guile contemning iustice."
Wisdom 14.31 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,14,31,"For it is not the powre of them that are sworne by, but the punishment of them that sinne, goeth alwayes through the trangression of the vniust."
Wisdom 15.1 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,1,"BVT o thou our God, art sweete, and true, patient, and disposing al thinges, in mercie."
Wisdom 15.2 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,2,"For if we sinne, we are thine, knowing thy greatnes: and if we sinne not we know that we are counted with thee."
Wisdom 15.3 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,3,"For to know thee, is absolute iustice: and to know iustice, and thy powre, is the roote of immortalitie."
Wisdom 15.4 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,4,"For mens inuention of euil art hath not brought vs into errour, nor the shadow of a picture being a labour without fruite, a shape grauen by diuerse colours,"
Wisdom 15.5 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,5,"the sight wherof geueth concupiscence to the senses, and he loueth the shape without life of a deade image."
Wisdom 15.6 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,6,"The louers of euils, are worthie to haue their hope in such thinges, both they that make them, and that loue, and that worshippe them."
Wisdom 15.7 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,7,"Yea and the potter pressing softe earth, with labour fashioneth euerie vessel to our vses, and of the same clay maketh the vessels, that are cleane to vse, and in like maner them that are contrarie to these: but what the vse of these vessels is, the potter is iudge."
Wisdom 15.8 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,8,"And with vaine labour he fashioneth a god of the same clay: he which a litle before was made of earth, and a litle after returneth backe whence he was taken, being exacted the debte of the life which he had."
Wisdom 15.9 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,9,"But his care is, not because he shal labour, nor because he hath a short life, but he contendeth with goldsmithes and siluer smithes: yea and he imitateth the copper smithes, and counteth it a glorie, because he maketh vaine thinges."
Wisdom 15.10 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,10,"For his hart is ashes, and his hope vaine earth, and his life viler then clay:"
Wisdom 15.11 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,11,"because he was ignorant who made him, and who inspired into him the soule which worketh, and who breathed into him the vital spirite."
Wisdom 15.12 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,12,"Yea and they estemed our life to be a pastime, and the conuersation of life made for a gayne, & that we must get euerie way euen of euil."
Wisdom 15.13 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,13,"For he knoweth that he offendeth aboue al men, which of the matter of earth fashioneth frayle vessels, and sculptils."
Wisdom 15.14 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,14,"For al the vnwise, and vnhappie aboue measure of the soule, proude are the enemies of they people, and rule ouer them:"
Wisdom 15.15 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,15,"because they haue estemed al the idols of the nations for goddes, which neither haue vse of eies to see, nor nosthrels to take breath, nor eares to heare, nor singers of the hands to handle, yea and their feete are slow to walke."
Wisdom 15.16 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,16,"For a man made them: and he that borowed breath, the same fashioned them. For no man can make God like to himself."
Wisdom 15.17 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,17,"For wheras himself is mortal, he maketh a dead thing with his wicked handes. For he is better then they, whom he worshippeth, because he in deede liued, though he were mortal, but they neuer."
Wisdom 15.18 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,18,"But they worship also most miserable beasts: for the senslesse thinges compared to these, are worse then they."
Wisdom 15.19 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,15,19,"Yea neither by sight can any man see good of these beasts. But they haue fled from the prayse of God, and from his blessing."
Wisdom 16.1 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,1,"FOR these thinges, and by the like to these, they haue worthely suffered torments, and were destroyed by a multitude of beasts."
Wisdom 16.2 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,2,"For the which torments thou didst wel dispose of thy people, to whom thou gauest the desire of their delectation a new taste, preparing them the quaile for meate:"
Wisdom 16.3 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,3,"that they in deede coueting meate, because of those thinges which were shewed and sent them, might be turned away euen from necessarie concupiscence. But they in short time being made needie, tastes a new meate."
Wisdom 16.4 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,4,For it behoued that without excuse destruction should come vpon them exercising tyrannie: but to these onlie to shew how their enemies were destroyed.
Wisdom 16.5 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,5,"For when the cruel wrath of beastes came vpon them, they were destroyed with the bytings of peruerse serpents."
Wisdom 16.6 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,6,"Howbeit thy wrath endured not for euer, but for chastisement they were trubled a short time, hauing a signe of saluation for the remembrance of the commandment of thy law."
Wisdom 16.7 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,7,"For he that turned to it, was not healed by that which he saw, but by thee the sauiour of al:"
Wisdom 16.8 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,8,"and in this thou didst shew to our enemies, that thou art he which deliuerest from al euil."
Wisdom 16.9 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,9,"For the bitings of locusts, and flies killed them, and there was found no remedie for their life: because they were worthie to be destroyed by such thinges."
Wisdom 16.10 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,10,But neither the teeth of venemous dragons ouercame thy children: for thy mercie coming healed them.
Wisdom 16.11 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,11,"For in memorie of thy wordes they were examined, & were quickly saued, lest falling into deepe obliuion, they might not vse thy helpe."
Wisdom 16.12 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,12,"For neither herbe, nor playster healed them, but thy word, o Lord, which healeth al thinges."
Wisdom 16.13 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,13,"For it is thou, o Lord, that hast powre of life and death, and bringest down to the gates of death, and fetchest agayne:"
Wisdom 16.14 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,14,"but man certes kille by malice, and when the spirit is gone forth, it shal not returne, neither shal he cal back the soule that is receiued:"
Wisdom 16.15 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,15,but it is vnpossible to escape thy hand.
Wisdom 16.16 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,16,"For the impious denying to knowe thee, haue bene scourged by the strength of thine arme, suffering persecution by strange waters, and haile, and rayne, and consumed by fyre."
Wisdom 16.17 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,17,"For that which was meruelous in water, which extinquisheth al thinges, fyre more preuayled: for the world is reuenger of the iust."
Wisdom 16.18 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,18,"For a certayne time, the fyre was mitigated, that the beasts which were sent to the impious might not be burnt, but that they seing might know that by Gods iudgement they suffer punishment."
Wisdom 16.19 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,19,"And at a certaine time the fyre aboue his powre burnt in water on euerie side, that it might destroy the nation of a wicked land."
Wisdom 16.20 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,20,"For the which thinges thou didst nourish thy people with the meate of Angels, and bread prepared, thou gauest them from heauen without labour, hauing in it al delectation, and the sweetnes of al taste."
Wisdom 16.21 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,21,"For thy substance did shew thy sweetnes which thou hast toward thy children, and seruing euerie mans wil, it was turned to that, that euerie man would."
Wisdom 16.22 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,22,"Yea snow and yce susteyned the force of fyre burning in hayle, and lightening in rayne destroyed the fruites of the enemies."
Wisdom 16.23 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,23,"And this againe, that the iust might be nourished, it forgat also his owne strength."
Wisdom 16.24 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,24,"For the creature seruing thee the Creatour, is fierce into torment against the vniust: and is made more gentle to doe good for them that trust in thee."
Wisdom 16.25 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,25,"For this cause euen then being transformed into al thinges they serued thy grace the nource of al, at their wil that desired thee:"
Wisdom 16.26 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,26,"that thy children might know, whom thou louedst o Lord, that not the fruites of natiuitie doe feede men, but thy word preserueth them, that beleue in thee."
Wisdom 16.27 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,27,"For that which could not be destroyed by fyre, forthwith being heated with a litle beame of the sunne did melt:"
Wisdom 16.28 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,28,"that it might be knowen to al men, that we ought to preuent the sunne to blesse thee, and at thy rysing of light to adore thee."
Wisdom 16.29 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,16,29,"For the fayth of the vngratful shal melt as winter yce, & shal perish as vnprofitable water."
Wisdom 17.1 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,1,"FOR thy iudgements o Lord are great, & thy wordes inexplicable, for this cause the soules lacking discipline haue erred."
Wisdom 17.2 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,2,"For whiles the wicked are perswaded that they can rule ouer the holie nation: fettered with the bands of darknes, and long night, shut vp vnder roofes, they haue lyen fugitiues from the euerlasting prouidence."
Wisdom 17.3 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,3,"And whiles they thincke that they be hid in obscure sinnes, they were dispersed by the darke couert of obliuion, being horribly afrayd and disturbed with exceding admiration."
Wisdom 17.4 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,4,"For neither did the denne that conteyned them, keepe them without feare: because the sound coming downe trubled them, and sorowful visions appearing to them, put them in feare."
Wisdom 17.5 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,5,"And no force certes of the fyre could geue them light, neither could the clere flames of the starres lighten that horrible night."
Wisdom 17.6 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,6,"But there appeared to them soden fyre, ful of feare: and being stroken with the feare of that face, which was not sene, they estemed the thinges that were sene to be werse:"
Wisdom 17.7 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,7,"and there were added derisions of the magical art, and contumelious rebuke of the glorie of their wisdom."
Wisdom 17.8 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,8,"For they which promised that they would expel feares and perturbations from the languishing soule, these with derision languished ful of feare."
Wisdom 17.9 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,9,"For although none of the monsters disturbed them: being moued with the passing by of beasts, and hissing of serpents, they perished trembling: and denying that they saw the ayre, which by no meanes any man could avoyde."
Wisdom 17.10 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,10,"For wheras wickednes is fearful, it geueth testimonie of condemnation: for a trubled conscience doth alwayes presume cruel thinges."
Wisdom 17.11 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,11,For feare is nothing els but a betraying of the aydes of cogitation.
Wisdom 17.12 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,12,"And whiles inwardly there is lesse expection, the greater doth he count the ignorance of that cause which maketh the torment."
Wisdom 17.13 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,13,"But they that during the night in deede impotent, and coming vpon them from the lowest and highest hel, slept the same sleepe,"
Wisdom 17.14 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,14,were sometime molested with the feare of monsters; sometime fayled by passing away of the soule: for soden feare and vnlooked for came vpon them.
Wisdom 17.15 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,15,"Moreouer if any of them had fallen downe, he was kept shut vp in prison with yron."
Wisdom 17.16 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,16,"For if one were a husbandman, or if a shepheard, or worker of the labours in the filde were sodenly taken, he susteyned necessitie ineuitable."
Wisdom 17.17 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,17,"For with one chayne of darkenes they were al tyed together. Whether it were the hissing winde, or among the thicke boughes of trees the sweete sound of birdes, or the force of water running downward exceedingly,"
Wisdom 17.18 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,18,"or the mightie sound of rockes tumbled headlong, or the running of playing beasts, that were not sene, or the mightie noyse of roaring beastes, or an echo resounding from the highest mountaynes: they made them swoone for feare."
Wisdom 17.19 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,19,"For al the world was illuminated with a cleare light, & none was hindred in their workes."
Wisdom 17.20 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,17,20,"But ouer them onlie was layd an heauie night, the image of darkenes, which was to come vpon them. They therfore were vnto themselues more heauie then the darknes."
Wisdom 18.1 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,1,"BVT to thy saincts there was very great light, and their voyce in deede they heard, but figure they saw not. And because themselues also did not suffer by the same thinges, they magnified thee:"
Wisdom 18.2 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,2,"and they that before had bene hurt, because they were not hurt, gaue thankes: and that there might be a difference, they asked a gift."
Wisdom 18.3 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,3,"For the which cause they had a burning pillar of fyre for a guide of the vnknowen way, and thou gauest them the sunne without hurt of a good harbour."
Wisdom 18.4 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,4,"They in deede worthie to lacke light, and to suffer the prison of darkenes, which kept thy children shut vp, by whom the vncorrupt light of the law began to be geuen to the world."
Wisdom 18.5 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,5,"When they decreed to kil the infantes of the iust: and one child being layd forth, and deliuered, thou to the reprouing of the, didst take away a multitude of children, and destroyedst them together in the mightie water."
Wisdom 18.6 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,6,"For that night was knowen before of our father, that they knowing in deede what othes they had credited, might be of better comfort."
Wisdom 18.7 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,7,"And by thy people in deede the health of the iust, was receiued, but destruction by the vniust."
Wisdom 18.8 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,8,"For as thou didst hurt the aduersaries: so vs also thou didst magnifie, prouoking vs."
Wisdom 18.9 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,9,"For the iust children of the good sacrificed secretly, and disposed the law of iustice in concorde: that the iust should receiue both good & euil alike, singing now the prayses of the fathers."
Wisdom 18.10 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,10,"But there sounded a disagreing voyce of the enemies, and a lamentable moorning was heard for the bewayled infants."
Wisdom 18.11 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,11,"And the seruant with the master was afflicted with the like punishment, and a man of the vulgar sort suffered the like thinges to the king."
Wisdom 18.12 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,12,"Al therfore alike by one name of death had dead ones innumerable. For neither did the liuing suffice to burie them: because in one moment, that which was the nobler nation of them, was destroyed."
Wisdom 18.13 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,13,"For concerning al thinges being incredulous because of the inchantments, but then first when there was destruction of the first begotten, they promised to be the people of God."
Wisdom 18.14 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,14,"For when quiet silence conteyned al thinges, and the night was in the midde way of her course,"
Wisdom 18.15 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,15,"they omnipotent word sayling out of heauen from the royal seates, lighted as a seuere conqueror vpon the middes of the land of destruction,"
Wisdom 18.16 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,16,"a sharpe sword carying thy vnfeyned commandment, and standing filled al with death, and reached euen to heauen standing on the earth."
Wisdom 18.17 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,17,"Then incontinent the visions of naughtie dreames trubled them, and feares vnlooked for came vpon them."
Wisdom 18.18 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,18,"And one here an other there, cast forth halfe aliue, shewed for what cause of death he died."
Wisdom 18.19 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,19,"For the visions, that trubled them, forewarned these thinges, that they might not perish as ignorant why they suffered euils."
Wisdom 18.20 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,20,"But then there touched the iust also a tentation of death, and a disturbance of the multitude was made in the wildernes: but thy wrath did not long continew."
Wisdom 18.21 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,21,"For a man without blame hasting to pray for the people, bringing forth the shilde of his ministerie prayer, and by incense alleaging supplication, resisted the wrath, and made an end of the necessitie, shewing that he is thy seruant."
Wisdom 18.22 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,22,"And he ouercame the multitudes, not in strength of bodie, nor with might of armour, but with a word subdewed he him, that vexed him, rehearding the oathes of the parents, and the testament."
Wisdom 18.23 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,23,"For when they were now fallen dead by heapes one vpon an other, he stood betwen, and cut of the violence, and separated that way which leadeth to the liuing."
Wisdom 18.24 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,24,"For in the vesture downe to the foote, which he had, was al the world: and the glorious thinges of the fathers were grauen in the foure iewels of stones & thy magnificence was written in the diademe of his head."
Wisdom 18.25 (ODRV),ODRV,Apocrypha,Wisdom,18,25,"And to these he that destroyed gaue place, & these did he feare: for the proofe onlie of wrath was sufficient."
